done, but the day war was declared the British Army had less than one
hundred serviceable flying machines of all types. What proved to be the
most useful plane used by the British for the first year of the war was

had factories that could make aero engines. But as to actual planes,
three hundred would be an outside figure of the number with which France
went to war. &quot;The use of the aeroplane in war was a subject which gave
much discussion, but few people, even in the army, thought that the
aeroplane would be of great service except for scouting. At the airdrome
where I learned to fly we used to practice dropping bombs---imaginary
