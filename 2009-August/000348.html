<PRE>Ss, after some months, that the friends and kinsfolk of Gisippus
resorted to him and together with Titus exhorted him to take a wife, to
which he consenting, they found him a young Athenian lady of marvellous
beauty and very noble parentage, whose name was Sophronia and who was
maybe fifteen years old. The term of the future nuptials drawing nigh,
Gisippus one day besought Titus to go visit her with him, for that he
had not yet seen her. Accordingly, they being come into her house and
