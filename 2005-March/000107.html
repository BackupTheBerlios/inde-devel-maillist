</I>Do you remember we talked about a mail from me that seemed not to arrive 
to the mailinglist? I wrote
something about ctags there but that mail is gone, so lets start this 
topic here.

We can use ctags for autocompletion and the class browser. For 
syntaxhighlighting this won't be too
interesting but perhaps we could find out class names that appear in the 
project and highlight them.

I haven't coded the last days, too but I looked at a program called 
&quot;ReZound&quot;. That's an audio editor
written in FOX. After having seen their code I could imange to implement 
some backend classes for
tasks like periodically updating the project's ctags file and so on. The 
goal is to take some code out
of MainWindow since it would grow too large otherwise.

We could probably divide the code maintainance. If I'm responsible for 
the editor widget, syntaxhighlighting
and so on it would only be logical to do the class browser. Whereas you 
were responsible for
project management and, lets say, the build instructions. Just an idea, 
yet I don't know if you agree.

&gt;<i>Also i thought about displaying multiple projects in InDE. After
</I>&gt;<i>completing the projehct browser, i will have a look at this. I think it
</I>&gt;<i>is a very easy enhancement but with great benefit.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>At the moment this might be a little complicated due to the central 
project settings structure in MainWindow.
Maybe we will have to rewrite it in order to store them in a list. I 
think we should still wait with it.

Regards,
Jannis (wo is still thinking about structure optimizations all the time)
