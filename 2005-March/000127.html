<PRE>Hi Jochen.

I apologize the delay of my commit but there are some things I'm still 
working on.

The settings API is already done. We won't need to load the settings 
file from
~/.foxrc/FoxDefault/InDE but instead have a file which is called 
~/.InDE/settings.cfg
The functionality provided by the API can also be used for the project 
settings.

The tabbed editor already has minimalistic functionality like opening, 
closing
and saving one or all opened files and adjusting the font. That's ok for 
now and
I will further work on that after my commit.

Currently, I rewrite my SettingsDialog after moving the functionality to 
load
and store the values it modifies into the class itself (instead of 
MainWindow).
There are some generic thoughts about what should be in MainWindow and what
in the dialogs/widgets but I will report on that later.

Next thing: I had a look into some documentation tools. I tested doxygen 
for example,
but it didn't satisfy me. So I went for NaturalDocs 
(www.naturaldocs.org) which
offers very clean documentation syntax and neat looking layout. We can 
discuss this
on the list but my next commit will already include NaturalDocs 
documentated headers
for all classes.

And another topic I'd shortly report about: I know you're working on the 
project browser
so I tweaked the filesystem browser a little bit. There are context 
menus for directories
and files now, both for opening one or more files and importing files 
and directories.
They already use the minimalistic TabEditor API which you will get to 
know tomorrow, I
hope.

Best Regards,
Jannis
