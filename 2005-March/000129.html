<PRE>Hi Jannis.

&gt;<i> Hi Jochen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize the delay of my commit but there are some things I'm still 
</I>&gt;<i> working on.
</I>
As far as i have another exam in a few hours i had no time to work on
InDE this weekend. 
I have some important dates this evening and tomorrow, so i will go on
to InDE thursday. Then there is a bit more time for the next two, maybe
three weeks, so things will grow ;)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The settings API is already done. We won't need to load the settings 
</I>&gt;<i> file from
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.foxrc/FoxDefault/InDE but instead have a file which is called 
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.InDE/settings.cfg
</I>
why *.cfg? Is this meant for Windows compatibility?

&gt;<i> The functionality provided by the API can also be used for the project 
</I>&gt;<i> settings.
</I>
I will have a look at it and arrange the project settings code.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The tabbed editor already has minimalistic functionality like opening, 
</I>&gt;<i> closing
</I>&gt;<i> and saving one or all opened files and adjusting the font. That's ok for 
</I>&gt;<i> now and
</I>&gt;<i> I will further work on that after my commit.
</I>
Nice to hear

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I rewrite my SettingsDialog after moving the functionality to 
</I>&gt;<i> load
</I>&gt;<i> and store the values it modifies into the class itself (instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> MainWindow).
</I>&gt;<i> There are some generic thoughts about what should be in MainWindow and what
</I>&gt;<i> in the dialogs/widgets but I will report on that later.
</I>
ok

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next thing: I had a look into some documentation tools. I tested doxygen 
</I>&gt;<i> for example,
</I>&gt;<i> but it didn't satisfy me. So I went for NaturalDocs 
</I>&gt;<i> (www.naturaldocs.org) which
</I>&gt;<i> offers very clean documentation syntax and neat looking layout. We can 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss this
</I>&gt;<i> on the list but my next commit will already include NaturalDocs 
</I>&gt;<i> documentated headers
</I>&gt;<i> for all classes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And another topic I'd shortly report about: I know you're working on the 
</I>&gt;<i> project browser
</I>&gt;<i> so I tweaked the filesystem browser a little bit. There are context 
</I>&gt;<i> menus for directories
</I>&gt;<i> and files now, both for opening one or more files and importing files 
</I>&gt;<i> and directories.
</I>&gt;<i> They already use the minimalistic TabEditor API which you will get to 
</I>&gt;<i> know tomorrow, I
</I>&gt;<i> hope.
</I>
The project browser is nearly finished. Things that are left to do are
the savings of the file lists and in InDE itself (not in the project
browser) the additions of files to the browser. 
As far as i see it is more sensefull to wait for your code to be checked
in to finish the browser. So i do not need to rewrite this code.

But it will only be a question of few hours to implement and test.

And some artworks are missing.... ;) 

BTW, while implementing the project browser i thought about possible
project structures.
One may wish to have a src/ dir and then split some modules to several
subdirs. E.g. 
src/main.cpp
src/some_other_stuff.cpp
src/module1/module1_implementation.cpp
src/module2/module2_implementation.cpp
...

I haven't included support for this yet. But i will have a look at this
later (for InDE &gt; 0.1).

My primaryly plans are to get the basic project browser to work, include
it to InDE functionality. After that the inclusion of the GPL and LGPL
headers for new files will be added.
As soon as the project settings work with the new structure for
mainwindow,... i will start implementing the SConstruct file creation,
which will be the hardest job of this list.

As soon as this work is done, i am fine to have an initial release.
Hopefully we can get our timelines together so far.
Maybe we can run for the weekend of March 18th-20th?

regards,
	Jochen
