<PRE>Hi Jannis.

only short answer, i must leave soon. More to come this evening, maybe
by phone?

</I>&gt;<i> InDE evolves, that's clear. It's only that I noticed parts of our code

</I>&gt;<i> thought-out and thus, there are many sources of error. I wanted to introduce
</I>&gt;<i> new ideas, not an immediate reorganization of the code.
</I>
I support this always. You know that.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I know. Replacing them with something better fortunately won't be 
</I>&gt;<i> much work.
</I>
Let me do this, as soon as work progresses in that area.
We have too much pieces in our todo list, that everyone can work on
every place.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> It currently also is responsible for opening a project and that will 
</I>&gt;<i> lead into conflicts
</I>&gt;<i> with - for example - the class browser. A kind of ProjectManager class 
</I>&gt;<i> with a list of
</I>&gt;<i> projects located in MainWindow simply would be better.
</I>
No it is not responsible for opening projects. It is just responsible
for filling the project browser with the contents (files) of the
project.
Maybe i've chosen not the best name for that function, but it loads the
contents from the view of the project browser, but not the complete
project.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Several projects would be no problem (that's what a ProjectManager would 
</I>&gt;<i> be responsible
</I>&gt;<i> for - handling projects). The Project class could be seen as a layer 
</I>&gt;<i> over ProjectSettings,
</I>&gt;<i> providing useful things like a project directory/files iterator class 
</I>&gt;<i> and things like that. I read
</I>&gt;<i> a lot about design patterns recently. That could be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is ok. Having a project manager, which is possessed by main window
and delegates to it's classes, not like now, were the accessing code has
to be implemented in MainWindow. But this leads to a small refactoring,
which can be done while reviewing the code.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The projectType must not be used as a static setting - but it could (yet 
</I>&gt;<i> must not) be
</I>&gt;<i> used for the File =&gt; New ... =&gt; Class. I'm thinking of a projectType 
</I>&gt;<i> dependent
</I>&gt;<i> Factory for the class creation, support several languages (each with 
</I>&gt;<i> their own
</I>&gt;<i> builder). Practical design patterns once again.
</I>
I aim to implement a different approach. This depends on my previous
explanation.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> No need to get angry. I'm not going to change anything of the code until 
</I>&gt;<i> I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen something more complete. But a single LICENSE file where you can
</I>&gt;<i> paste text into using a dialog doesn't require much work and a simple check
</I>&gt;<i> if the file exists when creating a class file should be no problem either.
</I>
This may be useful for the user defined license, but not for others.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you think of being able to provide something easier and user friendly 
</I>&gt;<i> - good!
</I>yes.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;That's what i always said. But if you remember, we decided not to change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this before other basic things are implemented and/or improved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;For example, the editor is very unstable. Why not first improve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;editor code base to eliminate all those ugly seg faults? InDE is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;absolutly useless as long the editor doesn't work properly!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, tri-state return values for saveDocument() are coming. That's the 
</I>&gt;<i> most disturbing
</I>&gt;<i> issue at the moment (from my point of view). The rest works as far as I 
</I>&gt;<i> can see.
</I>
As soon as i try to edit a file, InDE crashes..... works fine!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;You told me, you had written some code, that executes external commands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and fetches the output. Maybe you'll give me that code, i will see what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;can be done to this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That wasn't C++. It was written in Ruby. A terminal still is something 
</I>&gt;<i> completely
</I>&gt;<i> different as it includes getting a TTY device as well as writing and 
</I>&gt;<i> reading from it.
</I>
But this is not needed now.
I bet we have more important things to do now, than implementing a
terminal.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I should. But you have to think about at least two things: An IDE 
</I>&gt;<i> is not a tiny
</I>&gt;<i> program, instead it's complex. And we should have had more discussions about
</I>&gt;<i> it before writing code. It's true that you can't think of everything and 
</I>&gt;<i> write
</I>&gt;<i> a program from the scratch without problems - but one should at least try to
</I>&gt;<i> develop concepts before starting. That's what I learn with every day I 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with
</I>&gt;<i> InDE.
</I>
Ok, to express it in other words:
let us finish the work that is in progress and not yet ready (e.g.
stability of the editor, SCons constructing, some more methods for
adding, deleting,... files to the project). If all open points work
well, let us release this stuff and discuss about the problems we have
with this design, what may lead to problems, what can be done for better
modularization, which code should be moved to another abstraction
layer,....
If we do so, we get several benefits:
* users provide us with bugreports, so we get feedback on problems, we
might not have seen yet.
* we know, how we planned some things to implement
* we know, what will come next and what problems may occure for this (we
can not plan for features comming in years....)
* ...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we're not sophisticated programmes yet, so we have to realize that
</I>&gt;<i> development sometimes leads to a dead end where you have to reconsider
</I>&gt;<i> things. If we're honest, there is not much code yet. Most parts are attempts
</I>&gt;<i> which will be rewritten - maybe from the scratch - either way.
</I>
I do not see a dead end alley at the moment.

Including the above, InDE will be complex, so trying to design it once
will lead to dead ends. So, we have to do it step by step, and not
always try to rewrite it at once, no matter how much code exists. You
will continue this approach your life long and don't get any progress,
but you need to.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> InDE is not an application written down in a month or two. I'm not afraid
</I>&gt;<i> of rewriting core stuff that will be important for nearly everything in the
</I>&gt;<i> near future if it makes the software more sophisticated.
</I>
see above.
Do it step by step, and as i mentioned in several mails before, do it
when it's needed, and only those parts which need to be rewritten and
not the whole stuff at once. Also everything is new, it hasn't to be
better, only because it'sd new!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> It's not intended to be a &quot;sledge hammer&quot;. It's just brainstorming and 
</I>&gt;<i> writing
</I>&gt;<i> down experiences. Sure we could do everything step by step but that exactly
</I>&gt;<i> is the problem. If you add something like the ProjectManager (and 
</I>&gt;<i> Project) as
</I>&gt;<i> I suggested, more things have to be reviewed. If we had a comfortable 
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i> directory/files iterator the listing in the ProjectBrowser would be much 
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>
You introduced the sledge hammer!
Surely, you have to do it step by step, except you want to implement the
same stuff for years without any progress.

If that's what you intend....
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only problem is, those ideas require a complete review of InDE. I 
</I>&gt;<i> will do
</I>&gt;<i> that anyway (and make it a folder InDE-rev on my harddisk) but I won't 
</I>&gt;<i> apply
</I>&gt;<i> the code to the official InDE until you agree on it.
</I>
A complete review doesn't mean a complete rewrite.
And for me, i won't agree a complete rewrite now. At least the way you
plan it!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And, I still believe, it's best to get things actually working,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;releasing a snapshot and working on new features and improvements of old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;features.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Features aren't a problem, it's the way they're implemented currently. 
</I>
No, you are wrong. If that were true, you wouldn't actually do what
you're doing!

&gt;<i> That's not
</I>&gt;<i> your fault, as project leader I had to kick development into the right 
</I>&gt;<i> direction but
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately I didn't. I'm not that experienced yet.
</I>
Yes, you are the king!
Also the wrong way!

&gt;<i> &gt;If you don't want to end in chaos, follow a clear line and don't loose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;in senseless reorganizations every two weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Sure, little reorganizations are needed all times, but little. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;support a rewrite every two weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That's one of my vices. I know that I'm always running the risk of 
</I>&gt;<i> losing partners
</I>&gt;<i> this way but in this case we're simply naive when thinking the codebase 
</I>&gt;<i> is mature
</I>&gt;<i> or even ready for features do be written on the top of it.
</I>
I never said, the codebase were mature.
But rewriting it every two weeks doesn't do any better.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have to go step by step but that's not what we did in the beginning. 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, it's
</I>&gt;<i> hard to properly describe my thoughts.
</I>
That's what you hadn't done!
For me, at least my plannings for the project management is step by
step, at least so far you let me do it.
If i always have to bring my code back on, i can't progress from one
step to the next. That is the actual problem i have with improving my
own code. You don't give me the time for that!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And, let me do the restructuring of my code! I don't want to rewrite it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;every time!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that completely. But there's no need to shed tears about 
</I>&gt;<i> written
</I>&gt;<i> code when you are are going to write something new which adds to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't mind to throw code away if it's ugly or morbid.
But if that code is the base of thoughts and will be improved, you don't
have to throw it away, before any improvement could have been done to
it. That's why i'm crying!

Jochen
