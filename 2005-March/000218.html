<PRE>Hi Jochen,

&gt;<i> What are your skills? 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know about the internals of CVS or SVN? 
</I>&gt;<i> What other langueages than C++ do you &quot;speak&quot;?
</I>I dont know the internals of both CVS and SVN, I'm a sort of a 
pedestrian user of them.
However, I do 'speak' PHP, so I might be able to help in that area.

&gt;<i> Tasks, which could be of interest for you, where you do not have to know
</I>&gt;<i> all the FOX internals could be:
</I>&gt;<i> * add SVN or CVS support
</I>&gt;<i> * we work hard, to get InDE working for C++, you could maybe expand InDE
</I>&gt;<i> to support other languages.
</I>Yeah, the latter seems most likely now.

&gt;<i> I'd like to see support for Java and maybe we need something special for
</I>&gt;<i> SCons (wich is basically Python). But that isn't very high priority.
</I>What do you mean by &quot;something special for SCons&quot;?

&gt;<i> The complete project management is aimed for C++ projects. That also may
</I>&gt;<i> fit for C projects.
</I>&gt;<i> I only &quot;speak&quot; the following languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal. So,
</I>&gt;<i> supporting Java and C projects should be easy for me, but I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> anything about Python, Ruby, C#,.... and their structures.
</I>Much of PHP's basic syntax is a copycat of C, like C++ and Java.
Still, I could look into this, though it will not be a priority I'm 
afraid as I'm currently learning to use SQLite.
Speaking of SQLite, maybe SQL syntax highlighting is due, though there 
is the problem of dialects.

&gt;<i> May you have other skills, which will be of need and i haven't thought
</I>&gt;<i> about.
</I>&gt;<i> Just scream, what may be of interest to you ;)
</I>Well, I am apt to volunteer as a doc writer, but usually a good wiki 
eliminates this need.

Eugene
