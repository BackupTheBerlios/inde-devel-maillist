<PRE>Hi Vlad.

</I>&gt;<i>   dialog editor. We could give our sources to the developers of GUI
</I>&gt;<i>   editor and all will be happy ) What do the developers of InDE think
</I>&gt;<i>   about that?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>We don't use Makefiles and the autotools. Actually there isn't any
support for autotools planned. But we use a newer buildsystem called
SCons (<A HREF="http://www.scons.org/">http://www.scons.org/</A> ) and build our project management on top
of it. That means, if you create a new project, InDE creates a SCons
build file.

For the user there is no big difference:
scons
scons install

builds and installs the sources. Something like configure is not needed,
because SCons does this job in a very straightforward manner. Maybe you
want to have a look at their website.
SCons has serveral advantages, e.g. it is plattform independent, is very
easy to understand and to enhance. You will like it!

Now to the dialog editor. We haven't discussed this yet. Jeroen (the FOX
author) actually works on the serialization of FXObjects, in particular
how to store and load the widgets. Sander (another FOX developer) plays
around with it to get an impression, how to implement a dialog/GUI
editor, which supports for changes in the GUI, while the development on
a project goes on. They also plan to load the GUI on runtime, but it
seems they plan to implement it very different than you want.

I just searched the FOX archive to provide you with some links about
this discussion and found you as a member there. So i don't need to give
you the links and explain this in more detail, i guess you are more
familiar with Jeroens approaches about this topic than me.

I for myself had thought about including a GUI builder to InDE, but not
until the basic IDE supports you for normal C++ development. So please
feel free to give us feedback about your project progress. I guess this
will be a good point to work together.

Maybe this was a kick to start discussion about GUI builder for InDE. If
so, please feel free to provide us with infos and join the discussion ;)

Regards,
	Jochen
