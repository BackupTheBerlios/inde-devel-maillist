<PRE>Hi Eugene.

</I>
Yeah, I know it's hard to get through our chaotic minds. Hehe. Well, 
what we're currently doing is to write code for a first test release. 
This will give proof of our ideas and concepts. Then, we will most 
probably have an idea of how to improve our codebase.  For example, the 
TabEditor's API was written down in very short time compared to its 
complexity and thus is not very mature at all.

Contributing to the code without knowing FOX is difficult, of course. 
But perhaps you have some conceptual ideas on certain parts of an IDE in 
general? For example: Which parts should the focus be on? In which 
points do other IDEs fail? Are there useful features you ever wanted to 
have in an IDE? Or: When does an IDE get &quot;blown-up&quot; status?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That wasn't intended to be criticism. I am really glad both already

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; often
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's really hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to say when a certain task is done. Adding a certain feature is ok in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but defining the percentile status of a whole class is extremely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I think that what is important here is not an accurate/precise 
</I>&gt;<i> value, but just a rough gauge based on gut feeling, so that people 
</I>&gt;<i> have an idea what's happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After all, who cares if a task is said to be 60% complete when it is 
</I>&gt;<i> actually 59% complete?
</I>
Yes, that's how I treat it now. I add a task for everything I'm 
appending to my TODO list. I set a task to 100% when it's basically done 
but let it open if it is still supposed to be enhanced. Once something 
is really done I'm going to close it. The percentage of course is a real 
vague value.

Regards,
Jannis
