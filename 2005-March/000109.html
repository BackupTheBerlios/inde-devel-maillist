</I>It was just a comment from Jeroen that he's working on it. I haven't had
a look at it yet, but believe the next devel version may include the
first steps.

&gt;<i> We could probably divide the code maintainance. If I'm responsible for

</I>
Yes, that's sensefull. And if you want to do the class browsing .... ;)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Also i thought about displaying multiple projects in InDE. After
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;completing the projehct browser, i will have a look at this. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is a very easy enhancement but with great benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment this might be a little complicated due to the central

</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we will have to rewrite it in order to store them in a list. I

</I>
The central project settings aren't the problem for managing several
projects at once, i think. Storing them in a list and asking for the
actual one should fit. This could easily done by the project browser.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Jannis (wo is still thinking about structure optimizations all the time)
</I>
MainWindow is really growing fast. Maybe Jeroen may help us out with
some tricks how we can manage to distribute the functionality to some
classes without loosing the ability to update the settings and widgets
as easily as we do it now.

regards
