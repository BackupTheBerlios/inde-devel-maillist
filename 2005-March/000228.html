<PRE>Hi Jochen.

&gt;<i>Hi Jannis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>only short answer, i must leave soon. More to come this evening, maybe
</I>&gt;<i>by phone?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Generally a good idea. But another day would fit better - I'm fucking 
tired at the moment
and probably will already sleep in the evening. Hehe.

&gt;&gt;<i>The projectType must not be used as a static setting - but it could (yet 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>must not) be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>used for the File =&gt; New ... =&gt; Class. I'm thinking of a projectType 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>dependent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Factory for the class creation, support several languages (each with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>builder). Practical design patterns once again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I aim to implement a different approach. This depends on my previous
</I>&gt;<i>explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay. At first, thanks for bringing me back down to earth. I will 
optimize the current
TabEditor implementation concerning stability and you will have time to 
implement
what you wanted to. No need to hurry.

We will then throw out a first release some day and - as you suggested - 
discuss
about experiences, disadvantages and positive aspects - simply everything.

I will implement those parts I'd like to change - but won't - for 
myself. They won't
be introduced into the current codebase but perhaps we can use them for
the release thereafter. It really is some neat stuff, you'll see. Hehe.

&gt;<i>As soon as i try to edit a file, InDE crashes..... works fine!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Fuck, that's new to me. How can you reproduce this? Could you please
run InDE by

    ./InDE -tracelevel 2

and/or using a debugger like gdb and post the results into a bug report? 
Ha, that'd
be the first one!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>You told me, you had written some code, that executes external commands
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>and fetches the output. Maybe you'll give me that code, i will see what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>can be done to this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>That wasn't C++. It was written in Ruby. A terminal still is something 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>different as it includes getting a TTY device as well as writing and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>reading from it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But this is not needed now.
</I>&gt;<i>I bet we have more important things to do now, than implementing a
</I>&gt;<i>terminal.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Of course. The terminal was a sidenote, it's not important at the moment.

&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe I should. But you have to think about at least two things: An IDE 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is not a tiny
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>program, instead it's complex. And we should have had more discussions about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it before writing code. It's true that you can't think of everything and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a program from the scratch without problems - but one should at least try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>develop concepts before starting. That's what I learn with every day I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>deal with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>InDE.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, to express it in other words:
</I>&gt;<i>let us finish the work that is in progress and not yet ready (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>stability of the editor, SCons constructing, some more methods for
</I>&gt;<i>adding, deleting,... files to the project). If all open points work
</I>&gt;<i>well, let us release this stuff and discuss about the problems we have
</I>&gt;<i>with this design, what may lead to problems, what can be done for better
</I>&gt;<i>modularization, which code should be moved to another abstraction
</I>&gt;<i>layer,....
</I>&gt;<i>If we do so, we get several benefits:
</I>&gt;<i>* users provide us with bugreports, so we get feedback on problems, we
</I>&gt;<i>might not have seen yet.
</I>&gt;<i>* we know, how we planned some things to implement
</I>&gt;<i>* we know, what will come next and what problems may occure for this (we
</I>&gt;<i>can not plan for features comming in years....)
</I>&gt;<i>* ...
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ACK.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe we're not sophisticated programmes yet, so we have to realize that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>development sometimes leads to a dead end where you have to reconsider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things. If we're honest, there is not much code yet. Most parts are attempts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which will be rewritten - maybe from the scratch - either way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not see a dead end alley at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Including the above, InDE will be complex, so trying to design it once
</I>&gt;<i>will lead to dead ends. So, we have to do it step by step, and not
</I>&gt;<i>always try to rewrite it at once, no matter how much code exists. You
</I>&gt;<i>will continue this approach your life long and don't get any progress,
</I>&gt;<i>but you need to.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There are two ways: Reformating the base until they're good enough to 
build everything
else upon - or writing the base once and optimizing it step by step 
while implementing
everything else upon it. The latter seems odd to me. But I'll wait with 
my criticism until
the first test release is out.

&gt;&gt;<i>InDE is not an application written down in a month or two. I'm not afraid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of rewriting core stuff that will be important for nearly everything in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>near future if it makes the software more sophisticated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You introduced the sledge hammer!
</I>&gt;<i>Surely, you have to do it step by step, except you want to implement the
</I>&gt;<i>same stuff for years without any progress.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think it's better to have a base you can rely on than to have a base 
you have
to change whenever you realize it isn't yet ready for a new feature. To 
a certain
degree, both require changes from time to time - that's for sure - but 
my simple
criticism is that the current base is not yet ready for even the 
low-level features.

We can't handle projects by simply adding a ProjectSettings object to 
GUI widgets.
We need something better. OK, you seem to be up to something - then I'll 
give
you enough time to develop your stuff.

&gt;<i>Yes, you are the king!
</I>&gt;<i>Also the wrong way!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I always loved self-criticism - that's another one of my bad habbits. 
Hehe, really.

Regards,
Jannis
