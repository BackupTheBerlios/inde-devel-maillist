<PRE>Hi Eugene.

</I>Just thought about this. (Yes, I know I should rather learn for the
exams than hacking or thinking about InDE..... )

What are your skills? 
Do you know about the internals of CVS or SVN? 
What other langueages than C++ do you &quot;speak&quot;?

Tasks, which could be of interest for you, where you do not have to know
all the FOX internals could be:
* add SVN or CVS support
* we work hard, to get InDE working for C++, you could maybe expand InDE
to support other languages.

Syntax highlighting is actually supported for:
language &quot;C++&quot;
language &quot;C&quot;
language &quot;Shell&quot;
language &quot;Pascal&quot;
language &quot;Configure&quot;
language &quot;Python&quot;
language &quot;Ruby&quot;
language &quot;Xml/Html&quot;
language &quot;IDL&quot;
language &quot;C#&quot;
language &quot;Markup&quot;
    filesmatch &quot;*.html,*.xhtml,*.xml,*.sgml,*.php&quot;
language &quot;Make&quot;

I'd like to see support for Java and maybe we need something special for
SCons (wich is basically Python). But that isn't very high priority.

The complete project management is aimed for C++ projects. That also may
fit for C projects.
I only &quot;speak&quot; the following languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal. So,
supporting Java and C projects should be easy for me, but I don't know
anything about Python, Ruby, C#,.... and their structures.

Also it may be of interest to execute programs from Inde and fetch their
output (high priority!). This is needed very soon and could be added as
soon as the SCons file construction is implemented (i will start this
tommorow i hope). So we could add a menu command &quot;build project&quot; wich
basically executes &quot;scons&quot;, fetches the output and prints it to a Fox
Window.

May you have other skills, which will be of need and i haven't thought
about.
Just scream, what may be of interest to you ;)

Hope this motivates *g*

Jochen
