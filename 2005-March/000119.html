<PRE>Hi Jochen.

&gt;<i>The question is, do we need iterating?
</I>&gt;<i>But reading only those sections at those places, where we need it, would
</I>&gt;<i>save memory, keep the code cleaner, minimize sources for bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe something like FXbool GUIdirty may be used to indicate, that
</I>&gt;<i>several widgets should reread the settings and mark themself dirty.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We won't probably need FXbool GUIdirty since there are only two points 
in the code where settings
are changed:

    1. InDE settings dialog
    2. Project settings dialog

This means, directly after executing those dialogs settings are stored 
and written to the specific
settings file. (We do that in the quit/close project methods once again, 
just to be sure they are written).

At the moment, we have one variable for each option of the settings. We 
won't need the onUpd... and onCmd..
methods if we rewrite the settings dialogs so that they are given the 
values they need before execution (this would
reduce the types of dialogs to one (don't know whether this was 
explained clearly enough).

Instead of calling e.g. settings.editor.font we would use 
settings-&gt;find(&quot;EDITOR&quot;)-&gt;find(&quot;font&quot;). All we have to make
sure is to add a default value for each variable not being found while 
parsing the settings file (if we call
settings-&gt;find(&quot;EDITOR&quot;)-&gt;find(&quot;font&quot;) without an existing section 
&quot;EDITOR&quot; we would run into a segfault).

As you can see, our first attempt of MainWindow might be totally 
revised. The reason why it's hard to merge
my latest stuff into SVN - I am trying to avoid that you have to arrange 
with a new codebase every few days.
But the codebase yet isn't good enough to develop upon.

My suggestion therefor is that you use the current base for testing and 
working on the project management as
well as creating class with both, header and source file (including a 
license header depending on the project settings)
and so on. That seem to be the things you are highly interested in. 
Luckily, we're writing on an OO program so
merging those parts with a new code base won't cost much of time.

During this, my part would be to heavily think about (and finally, 
write) a new well organized, as compact as
possible structure for InDE. I will also have a look into other, similar 
programs and how they are structured.

What do you think?

Kind regards,
Jannis
