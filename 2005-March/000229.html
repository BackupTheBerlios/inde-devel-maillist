<PRE>Hi Jannis.

This sounds as a good way to go!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As soon as i try to edit a file, InDE crashes..... works fine!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Fuck, that's new to me. How can you reproduce this? Could you please

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ./InDE -tracelevel 2

</I>&gt;<i> and/or using a debugger like gdb and post the results into a bug report? 
</I>&gt;<i> Ha, that'd

</I>
I will have a look at it.
After some crashes while just beginning to hack i avoided to use InDE
and used Adie once again. So i have to try to reproduce.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two ways: Reformating the base until they're good enough to 
</I>&gt;<i> build everything
</I>&gt;<i> else upon - or writing the base once and optimizing it step by step 
</I>&gt;<i> while implementing
</I>&gt;<i> everything else upon it. The latter seems odd to me. But I'll wait with 
</I>&gt;<i> my criticism until
</I>&gt;<i> the first test release is out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's better to have a base you can rely on than to have a base 
</I>&gt;<i> you have
</I>&gt;<i> to change whenever you realize it isn't yet ready for a new feature. To 
</I>&gt;<i> a certain
</I>&gt;<i> degree, both require changes from time to time - that's for sure - but 
</I>&gt;<i> my simple
</I>&gt;<i> criticism is that the current base is not yet ready for even the 
</I>&gt;<i> low-level features.
</I>
The point is, can you say for sure, that after a rewrite everything is
ready to build all the future things upon it without doing major
changes?
That's why i want to do it step by step. Just to refactor always little
parts as they need to and not only sometimes the whole thing at once.

I intent to always think about the code base and do little changes, if
the code base doesn't fit instead of hacking without thinking and then
standing in front of a big mountain and start wondering where to start.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can't handle projects by simply adding a ProjectSettings object to 
</I>&gt;<i> GUI widgets.
</I>&gt;<i> We need something better. OK, you seem to be up to something - then I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> give
</I>&gt;<i> you enough time to develop your stuff.
</I>
I am actually up on the internals.
I have seen that the access to the projects and project settings is not
intentional, but every idea i had would be only cosmetic.
I believe we have to discuss this in more detail, but for this it seems
to be best to have all the basics. So we can estimate where the class
will evolve to.
