<PRE>Hi Jannis.

Thanks for the flowers.

</I>
It lacks strategy and it's not my fault ???
Thanks in advance!

But maybe you should wait untill things progress. If you've noticed, I
don't code weeks and weeks, before i commit the stuff to svn. So you
only notice the structure that is in the repository, but not what is in
mind. Keep on watching before kicking it.

&gt;<i> I established
</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor defines for the project type and that's been a really bad 
</I>&gt;<i> idea. 
</I>
What an ugly design decission.
There is absolutely no need for preprocessor defines! Just let me
improve the code and you will see, what way to go.

BTW, have you ever coded larger apps in Java? There are no preprocessor
defines, because you do not need them, if you use a good design.
Or do you just mean the PROJECT_TYPE_CPP,... which are from you and will
be removed soon?
&gt;<i> We should
</I>&gt;<i> better implement things like that using enum typedefs.
</I>
That's what is planned.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, nearly all actions concerning a project are handled by 
</I>&gt;<i> ProjectBrowser. Same with
</I>&gt;<i> actions concerning the filesystem. That's ok for now but in the near 
</I>&gt;<i> future there are
</I>&gt;<i> far more objects which will need to access those actions/methods. The 
</I>&gt;<i> class browser or the
</I>&gt;<i> CtagHandle for example. 
</I>
Well, the project browser implements only those methods, which
correspond to the project browser. Except the opening of a file, but
this seems to be another discussion. For those things we can start a new
thread to discuss.

Also, if it is needed to give things a better structure or way to
access, while implementing new features, THIS is the time to build this
structure, not any hour earlier!

&gt;<i> This means, instead of using ProjectBrowser for 
</I>&gt;<i> all things concerning
</I>&gt;<i> the projects we should use some meta-class like objects. I'd call them 
</I>&gt;<i> Project and ProjectManager
</I>&gt;<i> (a class managing a FXObjectListOf&lt;Project*&gt;, handling stuff like 
</I>&gt;<i> getProjectByPath(),
</I>&gt;<i> getCurrentProject() and so on).
</I>&gt;<i> This would have many advantages. For example, project and class browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> could set the current
</I>&gt;<i> project independently whenever they get focus or you select a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> item in them.
</I>
I remember you wouldn't even support several projects at once. What
should those classes do?

&gt;<i> We also could add functions like
</I>&gt;<i>      enum ProjectType Project::getProjectType()
</I>&gt;<i> to those classes.
</I>Why? A project may be a Java project, but uses several C++ classes or C
code to access system calls..... 
Having such a static project setting would kick out the need for SCons.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of a static list of natively supported licenses we could simply 
</I>&gt;<i> provide a dialog
</I>&gt;<i> to change the content of the LICENSE file (lets say in the main project 
</I>&gt;<i> dir). Depending on files
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere in the filesystem always equals chaos. 
</I>
You don't know how it will be implemented. So please don't argue about
that before you know how things will be done.
The only dependency to the file system occurs, if the user chooses a non
supported (non-standard) license.
Also wait and see before accusing it!

&gt;<i> Same applies to the 
</I>&gt;<i> syntax file. We simply could
</I>&gt;<i> support a syntax file located in the user's InDE directory (copied there 
</I>&gt;<i> on first startup), not
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the user to select a file located anywhere. A little dialog to 
</I>&gt;<i> edit it using an instance
</I>&gt;<i> of the Edit class (or a class similar to TabEditor just without tabs) 
</I>&gt;<i> would be enough, then.
</I>
That's right, but not my job.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the syntax highlighting we will also need a more elegant color 
</I>&gt;<i> editing solution than Adie uses.
</I>&gt;<i> In Adie, some rule colors of different styles overlap due to similar names.
</I>
That's what i always said. But if you remember, we decided not to change
this before other basic things are implemented and/or improved.
For example, the editor is very unstable. Why not first improve the
editor code base to eliminate all those ugly seg faults? InDE is
absolutly useless as long the editor doesn't work properly!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What we'll probably need some day is a kind of terminal widget. I 
</I>&gt;<i> already tried to implement one
</I>&gt;<i> using FOX during the last days but it seems to be too complex for the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment.
</I>
You told me, you had written some code, that executes external commands
and fetches the output. Maybe you'll give me that code, i will see what
can be done to this.

And one day means, that it is one day needed. No need to get a headache
by now!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember we wanted to release an early version of InDE this weekend? I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess we won't. There's
</I>&gt;<i> to much reformation needed to get things working.
</I>
Hey, slowly!
If you mean a reformation like the last, simply forget it! 
You removed several classes, deleted code,.....
I had two days work to get all functionality back to InDE and back to
work. If you start a new reformation such this one, I'd need more time.
And i hate to implement everything twice. 
Maybe you should read &quot;Software entwickeln mit eXtreme Programming&quot; von
Lippert, Roock, Wolf. I really recomend that book. And for you
especially the parts of Refactoring.

We can discuss about code improvements and than do it step by step. But
i will not support this, if the discussion or improvement is done with
the sledge hammer, like this mail or the last restructuring!

And, I still believe, it's best to get things actually working,
releasing a snapshot and working on new features and improvements of old
features.

It looks like every time you think about a new feature which could be
added any time, you find the InDE code not fitting anymore and rewriting
the complete code every time.
This isn't only ineffective, but also senseless and short viewed.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, I'm proud our project actually evolves and there's still notable 
</I>&gt;<i> activity and interest on
</I>&gt;<i> the part of the (little team of) developers.
</I>
Keep it so!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what will be the next steps?
</I>&gt;<i> Jochen, I know you'd like to schedule a release as early as possible but 
</I>&gt;<i> if we don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> stubmle into chaos we will have to discuss and share exchange views once 
</I>&gt;<i> again before (likely)
</I>&gt;<i> reorganizing part of the code.
</I>
If you don't want to end in chaos, follow a clear line and don't loose
in senseless reorganizations every two weeks.
Sure, little reorganizations are needed all times, but little. I don't
support a rewrite every two weeks.

And, let me do the restructuring of my code! I don't want to rewrite it
every time!

I still keep our schedule in mind!

Jochen
