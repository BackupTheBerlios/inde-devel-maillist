<PRE>Hi Jochen.

&gt;<i>Hi Jannis.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I observed progress on the project management a little and tested the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>NewClassDialog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>recently. Although there are good approaches I'd like to point out some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>weak points regarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>some of our concepts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for the flowers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The project management lacks of strategy although that's not your fault, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Jochen. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It lacks strategy and it's not my fault ???
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks in advance!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>InDE evolves, that's clear. It's only that I noticed parts of our code 
aren't very well
thought-out and thus, there are many sources of error. I wanted to introduce
new ideas, not an immediate reorganization of the code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But maybe you should wait untill things progress. If you've noticed, I
</I>&gt;<i>don't code weeks and weeks, before i commit the stuff to svn. So you
</I>&gt;<i>only notice the structure that is in the repository, but not what is in
</I>&gt;<i>mind. Keep on watching before kicking it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I established
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>preprocessor defines for the project type and that's been a really bad 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>idea. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What an ugly design decission.
</I>&gt;<i>There is absolutely no need for preprocessor defines! Just let me
</I>&gt;<i>improve the code and you will see, what way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I know. Replacing them with something better fortunately won't be 
much work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>BTW, have you ever coded larger apps in Java? There are no preprocessor
</I>&gt;<i>defines, because you do not need them, if you use a good design.
</I>&gt;<i>Or do you just mean the PROJECT_TYPE_CPP,... which are from you and will
</I>&gt;<i>be removed soon?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>better implement things like that using enum typedefs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's what is planned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Currently, nearly all actions concerning a project are handled by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>ProjectBrowser. Same with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>actions concerning the filesystem. That's ok for now but in the near 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>future there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>far more objects which will need to access those actions/methods. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>class browser or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>CtagHandle for example. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well, the project browser implements only those methods, which
</I>&gt;<i>correspond to the project browser. Except the opening of a file, but
</I>&gt;<i>this seems to be another discussion. For those things we can start a new
</I>&gt;<i>thread to discuss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It currently also is responsible for opening a project and that will 
lead into conflicts
with - for example - the class browser. A kind of ProjectManager class 
with a list of
projects located in MainWindow simply would be better.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also, if it is needed to give things a better structure or way to
</I>&gt;<i>access, while implementing new features, THIS is the time to build this
</I>&gt;<i>structure, not any hour earlier!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This means, instead of using ProjectBrowser for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>all things concerning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the projects we should use some meta-class like objects. I'd call them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Project and ProjectManager
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(a class managing a FXObjectListOf&lt;Project*&gt;, handling stuff like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>getProjectByPath(),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>getCurrentProject() and so on).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This would have many advantages. For example, project and class browsers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>could set the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>project independently whenever they get focus or you select a certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>item in them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I remember you wouldn't even support several projects at once. What
</I>&gt;<i>should those classes do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Several projects would be no problem (that's what a ProjectManager would 
be responsible
for - handling projects). The Project class could be seen as a layer 
over ProjectSettings,
providing useful things like a project directory/files iterator class 
and things like that. I read
a lot about design patterns recently. That could be useful.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We also could add functions like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     enum ProjectType Project::getProjectType()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to those classes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why? A project may be a Java project, but uses several C++ classes or C
</I>&gt;<i>code to access system calls..... 
</I>&gt;<i>Having such a static project setting would kick out the need for SCons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The projectType must not be used as a static setting - but it could (yet 
must not) be
used for the File =&gt; New ... =&gt; Class. I'm thinking of a projectType 
dependent
Factory for the class creation, support several languages (each with 
their own
builder). Practical design patterns once again.

&gt;&gt;<i>Instead of a static list of natively supported licenses we could simply 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>provide a dialog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to change the content of the LICENSE file (lets say in the main project 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>dir). Depending on files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>anywhere in the filesystem always equals chaos. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You don't know how it will be implemented. So please don't argue about
</I>&gt;<i>that before you know how things will be done.
</I>&gt;<i>The only dependency to the file system occurs, if the user chooses a non
</I>&gt;<i>supported (non-standard) license.
</I>&gt;<i>Also wait and see before accusing it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No need to get angry. I'm not going to change anything of the code until 
I've
seen something more complete. But a single LICENSE file where you can
paste text into using a dialog doesn't require much work and a simple check
if the file exists when creating a class file should be no problem either.

If you think of being able to provide something easier and user friendly 
- good!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Same applies to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>syntax file. We simply could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>support a syntax file located in the user's InDE directory (copied there 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>on first startup), not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>allowing the user to select a file located anywhere. A little dialog to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>edit it using an instance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of the Edit class (or a class similar to TabEditor just without tabs) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would be enough, then.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's right, but not my job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For the syntax highlighting we will also need a more elegant color 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>editing solution than Adie uses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In Adie, some rule colors of different styles overlap due to similar names.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's what i always said. But if you remember, we decided not to change
</I>&gt;<i>this before other basic things are implemented and/or improved.
</I>&gt;<i>For example, the editor is very unstable. Why not first improve the
</I>&gt;<i>editor code base to eliminate all those ugly seg faults? InDE is
</I>&gt;<i>absolutly useless as long the editor doesn't work properly!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, tri-state return values for saveDocument() are coming. That's the 
most disturbing
issue at the moment (from my point of view). The rest works as far as I 
can see.

&gt;&gt;<i>What we'll probably need some day is a kind of terminal widget. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>already tried to implement one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>using FOX during the last days but it seems to be too complex for the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You told me, you had written some code, that executes external commands
</I>&gt;<i>and fetches the output. Maybe you'll give me that code, i will see what
</I>&gt;<i>can be done to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That wasn't C++. It was written in Ruby. A terminal still is something 
completely
different as it includes getting a TTY device as well as writing and 
reading from it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And one day means, that it is one day needed. No need to get a headache
</I>&gt;<i>by now!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, I was intended as a short sidenote, nothing more.

&gt;&gt;<i>Remember we wanted to release an early version of InDE this weekend? I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>guess we won't. There's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to much reformation needed to get things working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hey, slowly!
</I>&gt;<i>If you mean a reformation like the last, simply forget it! 
</I>&gt;<i>You removed several classes, deleted code,.....
</I>&gt;<i>I had two days work to get all functionality back to InDE and back to
</I>&gt;<i>work. If you start a new reformation such this one, I'd need more time.
</I>&gt;<i>And i hate to implement everything twice. 
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe you should read &quot;Software entwickeln mit eXtreme Programming&quot; von
</I>&gt;<i>Lippert, Roock, Wolf. I really recomend that book. And for you
</I>&gt;<i>especially the parts of Refactoring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Maybe I should. But you have to think about at least two things: An IDE 
is not a tiny
program, instead it's complex. And we should have had more discussions about
it before writing code. It's true that you can't think of everything and 
write
a program from the scratch without problems - but one should at least try to
develop concepts before starting. That's what I learn with every day I 
deal with
InDE.

Maybe we're not sophisticated programmes yet, so we have to realize that
development sometimes leads to a dead end where you have to reconsider
things. If we're honest, there is not much code yet. Most parts are attempts
which will be rewritten - maybe from the scratch - either way.

InDE is not an application written down in a month or two. I'm not afraid
of rewriting core stuff that will be important for nearly everything in the
near future if it makes the software more sophisticated.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We can discuss about code improvements and than do it step by step. But
</I>&gt;<i>i will not support this, if the discussion or improvement is done with
</I>&gt;<i>the sledge hammer, like this mail or the last restructuring!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's not intended to be a &quot;sledge hammer&quot;. It's just brainstorming and 
writing
down experiences. Sure we could do everything step by step but that exactly
is the problem. If you add something like the ProjectManager (and 
Project) as
I suggested, more things have to be reviewed. If we had a comfortable 
project
directory/files iterator the listing in the ProjectBrowser would be much 
easier.

The only problem is, those ideas require a complete review of InDE. I 
will do
that anyway (and make it a folder InDE-rev on my harddisk) but I won't 
apply
the code to the official InDE until you agree on it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And, I still believe, it's best to get things actually working,
</I>&gt;<i>releasing a snapshot and working on new features and improvements of old
</I>&gt;<i>features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Features aren't a problem, it's the way they're implemented currently. 
That's not
your fault, as project leader I had to kick development into the right 
direction but
unfortunately I didn't. I'm not that experienced yet.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It looks like every time you think about a new feature which could be
</I>&gt;<i>added any time, you find the InDE code not fitting anymore and rewriting
</I>&gt;<i>the complete code every time.
</I>&gt;<i>This isn't only ineffective, but also senseless and short viewed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yet, I'm proud our project actually evolves and there's still notable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>activity and interest on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the part of the (little team of) developers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Keep it so!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So what will be the next steps?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Jochen, I know you'd like to schedule a release as early as possible but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>if we don't want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>stubmle into chaos we will have to discuss and share exchange views once 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>again before (likely)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>reorganizing part of the code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you don't want to end in chaos, follow a clear line and don't loose
</I>&gt;<i>in senseless reorganizations every two weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>Sure, little reorganizations are needed all times, but little. I don't
</I>&gt;<i>support a rewrite every two weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's one of my vices. I know that I'm always running the risk of 
losing partners
this way but in this case we're simply naive when thinking the codebase 
is mature
or even ready for features do be written on the top of it.

We have to go step by step but that's not what we did in the beginning. 
Hm, it's
hard to properly describe my thoughts.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And, let me do the restructuring of my code! I don't want to rewrite it
</I>&gt;<i>every time!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I understand that completely. But there's no need to shed tears about 
written
code when you are are going to write something new which adds to it.
