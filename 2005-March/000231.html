</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I will have a look at it.
</I>&gt;<i>After some crashes while just beginning to hack i avoided to use InDE

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There are two ways: Reformating the base until they're good enough to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>build everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>else upon - or writing the base once and optimizing it step by step 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>while implementing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>everything else upon it. The latter seems odd to me. But I'll wait with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>my criticism until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the first test release is out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think it's better to have a base you can rely on than to have a base 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to change whenever you realize it isn't yet ready for a new feature. To 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>degree, both require changes from time to time - that's for sure - but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>my simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>criticism is that the current base is not yet ready for even the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>low-level features.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The point is, can you say for sure, that after a rewrite everything is
</I>&gt;<i>ready to build all the future things upon it without doing major
</I>&gt;<i>changes?
</I>&gt;<i>That's why i want to do it step by step. Just to refactor always little
</I>&gt;<i>parts as they need to and not only sometimes the whole thing at once.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure. The problem is that basic stuff almost everytime involves tons of 
changes
to the things relying on it. I can't imagine the work that would be 
necessary to
reorganize codebase with, lets say 100k lines of code. The advantage of
refacturing now would be that there aren't that much components written yet.
But that's just how I see things.

&gt;<i>I intent to always think about the code base and do little changes, if
</I>&gt;<i>the code base doesn't fit instead of hacking without thinking and then
</I>&gt;<i>standing in front of a big mountain and start wondering where to start.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We can't handle projects by simply adding a ProjectSettings object to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>GUI widgets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We need something better. OK, you seem to be up to something - then I'll 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you enough time to develop your stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am actually up on the internals.
</I>&gt;<i>I have seen that the access to the projects and project settings is not
</I>&gt;<i>intentional, but every idea i had would be only cosmetic.
</I>&gt;<i>I believe we have to discuss this in more detail, but for this it seems
</I>&gt;<i>to be best to have all the basics. So we can estimate where the class
</I>&gt;<i>will evolve to.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Jochen
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sounds good actually. I have ideas about that. As already mentioned I 
could imagine
a kind of meta information object for each project which wraps the 
information it
fetches from its ProjectSettings member into something useable for other 
components.
Like e.g. a project directory/file iterator class which could be used in 
the project browser
- or a default &lt;LanguageOfChoice&gt;ClassBuilder object which is factorized 
dependent on the
projectType. those ClassBuilder (e.g. CppClassBuilder) could be used to 
store and validate
information entered into the NewClassDialog. That's one of those things 
for the future which I'm
currently working on. Intelligent components which aren't easy to 
integrate into the current
codebase without much changes.

Regards,
Jannis
