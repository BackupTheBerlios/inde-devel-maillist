That's where we started once.

I don't mind. I am young and flexible *g*
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion therefor is that you use the current base for testing and

</I>&gt;<i> well as creating class with both, header and source file (including a

</I>&gt;<i> and so on. That seem to be the things you are highly interested in. 
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily, we're writing on an OO program so
</I>&gt;<i> merging those parts with a new code base won't cost much of time.
</I>
Fortunately the dependencies aren't very important for me, because most
work is done in seperate classes.
But testing the functionality means a) writing testapps, which i do for
certain classes, or b) using InDE for tests, wich is needed for other
things.
Why should i include all code to InDE to test the functionality, if all
this code, which has costed hours of work, is just thrown away and has
to be done completely from ground up again?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> During this, my part would be to heavily think about (and finally, 
</I>&gt;<i> write) a new well organized, as compact as
</I>&gt;<i> possible structure for InDE. I will also have a look into other, similar 
</I>&gt;<i> programs and how they are structured.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Don't loose the sight of it. That's what i think.
Implementing the settings as you proposed in the other mail and
finishing the editor would be a greater job by now. I guess with ongoing
development we will get a need for certain refactorings anyway. So do
it, if you need it, may be more straightforward and more satisfying,
because you see results and not only work to be done and to be thought
about it.

Actually we have no support for different views. What about them? If you
start to think about it, you will most probably be happy, if you arrange
to have a initial release at x-mas. OO supports us in refactoring, for
that we are not developing with something like C, where it is a pain in
the ass to refactor.

Don't get me wrong. Design and a good structure are very important. But
overdesigning can be a shot to the back. There always exists a better
solution, but trying to get the best solution before going on will never
let you go on. Trying to do the best you can at that point may fit best,
making things better at a later time with more knowlege about what is
needed and what blocks will lead to better solutions. At least this is
my point of view.

As far as i am used to develop with Java, i found it normal to rewrite
some classes or to move some code to new classes, which are than
insantiated from this class and so on. This is fun as far as you do it
as soon as it is needed, not earlier. And most of the time you get a
speed boost or some satisfaction because you latly growen code is now
more clear ;)
