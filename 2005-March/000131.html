&gt;<i> Hi Jochen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As far as i have another exam in a few hours i had no time to work on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;InDE this weekend. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, good luck then.
</I>
Thanks.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The settings API is already done. We won't need to load the settings 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;file from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;~/.foxrc/FoxDefault/InDE but instead have a file which is called 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;~/.InDE/settings.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;why *.cfg? Is this meant for Windows compatibility?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, no. We give it any extension. What do you prefer? .ini would be 
</I>&gt;<i> logical but unusual for Linux whereas
</I>&gt;<i> .conf would be the Linux way.
</I>
I prefer *.conf or no extension. As far as this is a settings for Unix,
we do not need a extension. If the file is named .InDE/settings it is
clear what it does. But if extension, i prefer *.conf, because it's the
Unix way.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;But it will only be a question of few hours to implement and test.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And some artworks are missing.... ;) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I had a look at tons of icon archives (both, KDE-/Gnome-like and 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows). I came to the conclusion
</I>&gt;<i> that best would be to use typical Windows 2000 or XP icons. Wait a few 
</I>&gt;<i> days and I will upload an archive
</I>&gt;<i> which you can look at.
</I>
Are these icons free?
If not, we can not use them because of the GPL of InDE.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;BTW, while implementing the project browser i thought about possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;project structures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;One may wish to have a src/ dir and then split some modules to several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subdirs. E.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;src/main.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;src/some_other_stuff.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;src/module1/module1_implementation.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;src/module2/module2_implementation.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I haven't included support for this yet. But i will have a look at this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;later (for InDE &gt; 0.1).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Okay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As soon as the project settings work with the new structure for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;mainwindow,... i will start implementing the SConstruct file creation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;which will be the hardest job of this list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's going to be hard - especially if we consider that later the 
</I>&gt;<i> user might have to add different
</I>&gt;<i> libraries for each platform he wants his software to be built on. For 
</I>&gt;<i> that, our settings class
</I>&gt;<i> might need something like a
</I>&gt;<i>      typedef FXArray&lt;FXString&gt; StringArray
</I>&gt;<i> and functions like
</I>&gt;<i>     setStringArrayValue()
</I>&gt;<i>     getStringArrayValue()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we will see.
</I>
I guess we have to carry some information together to locate the
problems. 
I have some ideas, but haven't thought in depth to all upcomming
problems. This will most probably be a topic next week(end).

But on the other hand, we could arrange this to be solved in later
versions more intelligent. As far as we use the project settings, one
can specify all needed libraries there and depending on this the correct
SConstruct is build. As soon as you move the project to another
plattform, it is needed to revise the project settings to change the
libraries.
I guess, that will do it for the very first release. (I also guess that
noone will use InDE 0.1 for large projects and especially not for too
complicated cross plattform projects)

All in depth SConstruct buildings depend on the task i added about the
project settings to know the compiler and OS. 

For all this we need to know compiler switches, library names (or
differences in them), linker options and so on. This will also be very
interesting for debugging support.....
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As soon as this work is done, i am fine to have an initial release.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hopefully we can get our timelines together so far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Maybe we can run for the weekend of March 18th-20th?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That should be possible, I think.
</I>
Just to mention:
for the release we should add GPL headers to all files, an AUTHOR,
LICENSE, README and INSTALL file. The GPL headers can use a link to the
AUTHOR's file, to avoid future problems, if a new developer joins the
project *g*

So far. I guess this one was the last for this morning. I have to leave
soon for the exam...

regards,
	Jochen
