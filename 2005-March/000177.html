<PRE>Hi Jannis.

&gt;<i> Hard to say. I understand the first release as a kind of testrun. The 
</I>&gt;<i> TabEditor class
</I>&gt;<i> I've written very fast and withought spending much attention on how good 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation really is. And that's the point where I can't really cope 
</I>&gt;<i> with this
</I>&gt;<i> task system (remember I doubted it already in the beginning?): often 
</I>&gt;<i> it's really hard
</I>&gt;<i> to say when a certain task is done. Adding a certain feature is ok in 
</I>&gt;<i> this system
</I>&gt;<i> but defining the percentile status of a whole class is extremely 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I will set the status to something about 40% since we're already 
</I>&gt;<i> able to highlight
</I>&gt;<i> text and stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, that's right. I guess it's the question how to interpret the
tasksystem.

My interpretation is like this:
* adding a task to show, that something is planned and show the priority
of this task relative to other things
* if the task is in developing state, actualize the progress bar to show
it's in development
* if it works and has the basic functionality you planned, set it to
100% and maybe close the task
* if you want to add something important, which isn't in the first task,
open a new task
* if the code needs improvement, open a new task.

Example for the TabEditor class:
* open a task to show it has to be implemented
* as development goes on, set the percentage to higher values
* if it is ready to use, finish and close the task
* open a new task for ctags-support
* if you think, some things has to be changed, also open a task for this


That's how i saw the task system used by other projects and think this
is one possible way to go. At least this may be most usefull for users
to see what's going on and what they can expect for the next releases.
Surely, there will always be a task at high priority, that isn't
implemented, because you see the need to work on another part at that
certain time...

Maybe our other users at the mailinglist have wishes how the task system
is to be handled?

Regards,
	Jochen
