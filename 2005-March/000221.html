<PRE>Hi all.

I observed progress on the project management a little and tested the 
NewClassDialog
recently. Although there are good approaches I'd like to point out some 
weak points regarding
some of our concepts.

The project management lacks of strategy although that's not your fault, 
Jochen. I established
preprocessor defines for the project type and that's been a really bad 
idea. We should
better implement things like that using enum typedefs.

Currently, nearly all actions concerning a project are handled by 
ProjectBrowser. Same with
actions concerning the filesystem. That's ok for now but in the near 
future there are
far more objects which will need to access those actions/methods. The 
class browser or the
CtagHandle for example. This means, instead of using ProjectBrowser for 
all things concerning
the projects we should use some meta-class like objects. I'd call them 
Project and ProjectManager
(a class managing a FXObjectListOf&lt;Project*&gt;, handling stuff like 
getProjectByPath(),
getCurrentProject() and so on).
This would have many advantages. For example, project and class browsers 
could set the current
project independently whenever they get focus or you select a certain 
item in them.
We also could add functions like
     enum ProjectType Project::getProjectType()
to those classes.

Instead of a static list of natively supported licenses we could simply 
provide a dialog
to change the content of the LICENSE file (lets say in the main project 
dir). Depending on files
anywhere in the filesystem always equals chaos. Same applies to the 
syntax file. We simply could
support a syntax file located in the user's InDE directory (copied there 
on first startup), not
allowing the user to select a file located anywhere. A little dialog to 
edit it using an instance
of the Edit class (or a class similar to TabEditor just without tabs) 
would be enough, then.

For the syntax highlighting we will also need a more elegant color 
editing solution than Adie uses.
In Adie, some rule colors of different styles overlap due to similar names.

What we'll probably need some day is a kind of terminal widget. I 
already tried to implement one
using FOX during the last days but it seems to be too complex for the 
moment.

Remember we wanted to release an early version of InDE this weekend? I 
guess we won't. There's
to much reformation needed to get things working.

Yet, I'm proud our project actually evolves and there's still notable 
activity and interest on
the part of the (little team of) developers.

So what will be the next steps?
Jochen, I know you'd like to schedule a release as early as possible but 
if we don't want to
stubmle into chaos we will have to discuss and share exchange views once 
again before (likely)
reorganizing part of the code.

Kind regards,
Jannis
