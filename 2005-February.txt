Message-ID: <1108160360.1606.38.camel@jogix.sojox>

Hi.

I am waiting for FOX 1.4.3 to be released. I haven't yet downloaded 1.4
because of the many bugs in it. I guess it will be just a matter of time
- say days or better hours - that 1.4.3 will be released.

Jeroen does a really good job, but i had prefered he had released the
actual 1.4.0 as 1.3.27 or better 1.3.90 or 1.4rc1 and stated it as the
first beta for 1.4. So the 1.4 release is not yet a stable on but rather
a development beta pre 1.4 one.

How do you think about it?

regards
	Jochen

Hi Jochen.

FOX 1.4.3 was released today.

Yes, it seems as if 1.4 is not that stable as one might have expected. 
Yet, Jeroen did some
important fixes in 1.4.2 and 1.4.3. 1.4.3 to me seems to be as good as 
the latest development
release although I'll use the latter to develop my stuff.

By the way, if he had released it as 1.3.90 he wouldn't have followed 
the naming scheme
of FOX (the last number defines the amount of patches which were 
released after the
1.3.0 release).

Jannis

Hello Jochen,

I'm of the opinion we should call inDE with an upper case letter at the

this looks better. What do you think?

I have started to announce tasks I am going to be working at for the

enter some other tasks later, only that you are able to follow my 
current work. If you have any comments,
questions or ideas on some of the tasks, we can discuss them here, I think.

Yes, you are right. I think he had had to call it 1.4rc1 or similar.
Sometimes it is very difficult to understand the release numbers. The
1.3.90 scheme had been the way Linus Torvalds had named it. The
percentage of readiness.
But Jeroen follows the GNU way. And although gcc is GNU software, they
do not follow the GNU convention. gcc 3.3 _is_ a stable release.

But now fox 1.4.3 is out and i hope it will run ok. I will compile it in
an hour or so und just test it.

I really don't mind. But i'd prefer to define it once and leave it this
way.

I was out the complete day - my nephew had birthday and so i had to be
there.

I will look at the tasks later to get an overview. 

BTW, did you upload your actual code to svn? Maybe i could work at the
one or other task. Or maybe we define some more tasks which seem
important for the first steps and i start to implement some of them. I
have some time left until mid of February, after then i can only help
with little tasks until mid of April. exams .... :(

Hi again,

Okay then, let's call it InDE, not inDE.

I'll upload some stuff as soon as possible. I wanted to implement some 
basics in our App class.
As long as this isn't done yet, there's nothing you can start with. But 
when it's done, I will upload it and
you can do some dialogs perhaps? At the moment, I can't tell exactly 
what steps are going to be done next.

Jannis

Hi Jochen.

I have kind of a task for you.

You know we want to implement support projects (a collection of source 
and header files) in InDE. Therefor we
need a file where all project information is written to.

FXSettings supports ini-like files, so this is what we should use.
My task for you: Think about which sections we will need for this and 
which variables.

I'll start with a few basic things:

Section: INFO
Variable: PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_DESCRIPTION, PROJECT_VERSION, 
PROJECT_TARGET (executable, shared/static library)

Section: PATHS
Variables: INCLUDE_PATHS, LIBRARY_PATHS, SOURCE_DIR (of project), 
INCLUDE_DIR (of project), BUILD_DIR

Section: DEPENDENCIES
Variables: LIBRARIES

Section: BUILD
Variables: BUILD_TYPE (debug/release)

Feel free to criticise, add, remove, change them the way you think it 
makes sense. All you have to concentrate on is what things are
needed for all kinds of projects that come to your mind. Hehe.

Best regards,
Jannis

Where do you want to put these config files?
One central point or something like Eclipse's workspaces?

Hi Jochen.

I thought about something like this:

InDE will have a global variable which defines the base directory for 
all projects (that's
how most of the IDEs work, I think - Eclipse, Anjuta etc.). Of course it 
will appear in some
kind of global settings dialog.

The user creates a project and defines name and version number for it. 
InDE will then create
a project directory which includes both (e.g. InDE-0.0.1 or FOX-1.4). In 
this directory a
project configuration file (let's call it "project.ini" or 
"project.cfg") is placed by InDE.
All project settings (divided into severeal sections - see my last mail) 
are written into
this file.

An example would be:

# Default InDE settings:
Linux: /usr/local/share/InDE/InDE.cfg
Windows (Registry): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/InDE/

# User-wide InDE settings:
Linux: /home/jannis/.InDE/InDE.cfg
Windows (Registry): HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/InDE/

# Example base directory
Linux: /home/jannis/Projects
Windows: C:\Projects

# Example project directories
Linux: /home/jannis/Projects/InDE-0.0.1/
Windows: C:\Projects\InDE-0.0.1

Linux: /home/jannis/Projects/FOX-1.4
Windows: C:\Projects\FOX-1.4

# Example project configurations
Linux: /home/jannis/Projects/InDE-0.0.1/project.cfg
Windows: C:\Projects\InDE-0.0.1\project.cfg

Linux: /home/jannis/Projects/FOX-1.4/project.cfg
Windows: C:\Projects\FOX-1.4\project.cfg

--

That's it. Perhaps there will be some more files besides project.cfg
which have to be initially put into the project directory like e.g.
SConstructs or something like this. We'll see.

That should be enough for the moment.

If you don't have ideas about import configuration sections/variables
for project.cfg, I'll create the "Create new project" dialog. This will
be a first example of how the other dialogs could be designed and how
they could be integrated into the main window class. That having done
I will be able to share the code via SVN so we can discuss about the
next steps.

Any objections?

Regards,
Jannis

Hm. I do not like InDE-0.0.1 as you have to create a new project for a
new version.
It were ok, if you only defined InDe-0.0 and the patchlevel is the build
target. But, both ways, will restrict the users to follow our release
numbering scheme.

Before discussing this in more detail, another demand, as i believe we
should include.
Take a compiler project for example. The compiler project may be divided
into a preprocesor subproject, a parser (or many, e.g. to support many
languages like gcc) subproject, and last but not least the targets
subprojects (i386, ppc, mipsel,...).
So you will create one project, named compiler, and several subproject,
named parser, preprocessor, target,... they all will build as objects
(libs) and build together with several rules to a complete compiler.
So you need to create subprojects, which will be handled as severel
directories in the IDE and will build at once, if you push the build
project button. And you may specify several subprojects to be included
or not for the build target (e.g. preprocessor + cpp-parser +
target-amd64)

I'd prefer it to have the subprojects (if any) named with the main
version numbers, not the base project. So you may specify the workplace
version-dependend and for example fix bugs in the stable branch while
you normally develop in the unstable branch. This also would require a
diff and merge tool to integrate code from one branch into the other.
This also is in need for a new subproject, but this could be handled
like this: subproject -> new version tree -> get new version number ->
based on old version number -> inDe creates new subdirectory/subproject
and copies the files from the base to the new directory. But, taking fox
versions as base, the subproject's version directories are named
fox-1.4, the patchlevel is then used for the new build target for a
release build.

And maybe you could include something like Make's make distcheck, wich
throws out an ready to ship tar.gz, which also could be easyly archived,
working together with a archive old branch function.

The above way to handle projects and version numbers relies on a
straightforward SConsript file tree, but is easyly supported by SCons.

What do you think about this project structure?

> That's it. Perhaps there will be some more files besides project.cfg
> which have to be initially put into the project directory like e.g.

project.cfg and SConscript will be all files needed. And the SConstruct
file in the major project dir.

That's not the problem....
I am just thinking about how to contribute. What do you actually expect?
If i should implement just the advanced setting class, i do not need any
InDE code, because it's a standalone class derived from fox.
But implementing the create new dialog based on the settings class will
need the code base to include it.

Hi Jannis.

Have you already thought about the project web site? Do you already have
a design?

As a design idea i will post a link, because this site looks very nice
in my opinion: http://rarewares.org/

Changes for us, or structure:
* white background with logo at the head and the short description you
have added to the project description site
* blue tables with white letters
* navigation menu
* main table with contents
* maybe a third table with news headlines 

I think we do not need, as at the above link, the navigation menu at the
top, also the marketing buttons on the left side. Just a very simple,
nice looking, and most important, very good structured website, where
you can find information intuitivly and do not have to search for the
contents.

Basic menu structure may look like:
Home / News
About
Download
Screenshots
FAQ
Links
Projects

Home / News is self speaking, About also. But there we can not only
describe the features, but also some ideas for InDE, why we started this
project, what we want to reach, print a roadmap,...
Download may be a link to the project download side, or better, a short
description, how to build under different plattforms and there the link
to the project download side.
Screenshot is self speaking, too, FAQ may be divided into two sections:
doc and faq, maybe we should name it doc/faq
Under Links we may add things like fox-toolkit, fox-community, maybe
foxdesktops, if it advances, several c++ sources,....
Projects may be the site where our community may set links, screenshots
and dscriptions for projects developed using InDE ;)

Personally, I don't like ~/.foxrc/InDE. There's more sense in creating an
own program directory in the home dir. There may be some other things
besides user settings (e.g. user specific syntax file) and it would be
too chaotic if they were spread to ~/.foxrc/InDE and ~/.InDE.

You're right. I'd like to correct myself. Lets keep it simple using the 
project name (without numbers) as
directory and nothing else.

Yeah, creating a tar.gz or tar.bz2 (which I prefer) will be easy with 
SCons. I'll add this to the build script.
An archiving function for these dist-files should be no problem, too.

Subprojects ... Hm, that's difficult stuff, I guess. I'd like to hold 
off on this until we have a stable
code base which means a program that actually works without subprojects.
Once we have reached that point we could still think about implementing 
subprojects. It's an
interesting idea indeed.

Okay, I understand. I know it seems a bit as if I would try to handle 
dozends of tasks all at one
time without having a clear mind or something. Hehe.

Well then, I will meditate some minutes about the next steps in order to 
provide you some
clear information about what is to be done.

No problem. That's good as long as we turn them into something 
constructive (I think that is
what we do).

Hi,

I totally agree with your suggestions concerning the structure. It 
should be as intuitive and simple as
possible.

Personally, I don't like white text on a dark color. The main problem 
regarding the website is the time.
I don't have enough at the moment to create a new website.

Correct me if I'm wrong: It seems you won't have much time the next two 
months as well. Therefor
I'd suggest to try a usual CMS for the page. This gives us the 
opportunity to post news and stuff without
having to write a system for this before. Would be the easiest and 
probably not the worst solution.

What do you think?

My suggestion: http://typo3.com/

Regards,
Jannis

I do not think it is too difficult. But you're right, this is a feature
for future versions. We actually should care about the very basics.

No, that's not what i meant. It is a bit easier for me to see what is to
be done and where to start and what's related to it if i had seen any
code ;)

Yes. And i personally like roadmaps. They do not only help others to see
what will be included in future versions, but help yourself storing all
ideas in a central area. Others may add good ideas if they know what you
will produce, join the discussion or just increase the audience. But
primary intention is to keep the own ideas.

I started programming at old DOS times (not to mention C64*g*), most of
the time with borland pascal. I don't know if you still know those dos
environments from turbo pascal 6 and 7 and turbo c++ 3. Nice blue
background and yellow or white letters on it. Turbo c++ 3.0 was shipped
with standard light green letters. I find it easier for the eyes to read
than black on white as the contrast and light intensity is too high *g*
Maybe i am too much night active *g*

CMS is not too bad for it. I hadn't suggested it, because you also
prefer plain html ;)

haven't heard too much good things about it, but i don't mind. As long

Hi Jochen.

Have a look at http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/inde/

I have commited my current InDE directory to SVN. What you see there is 
the following:

    - naked App class with syntax file loading support (in Win32 this 
may become complicated somehow)
    - nearly empty MainWindow class (note: the project view is odd, I 
just put it in there as a placeholder)
    - empty SettingsDialog class which later can be used to adjust the 
user's InDE settings
    - DialogTitle class which could be something like a default header 
for our dialogs
    - SConstruct to build InDE on Linux

... and some more things (like an ugly splash screen for example. Hehe)

Please tell me what you think of this skeleton. The layout perhaps is 
not very exciting but editor and project
view will take some time. I think we should manage this InDE settings 
dialog and a project creation dialog
first, before we have a look at the rest.

Regards,
Jannis

Subject: [InDE-devel] Preliminary roadmap for InDE
Message-ID: <420FDE76.1090005@sten-net.de>

Q = questions => discussion => decision
T = tasks



1. InDE settings dialog and structure
-------------------------------------
This will be very import for nearly every one of the other classes.

Q1.1 - Which variables / options might be needed?
Q1.2 - In which sections should they be divided?
Q1.3 - How should settings be stored in the MainWindow class?
Q1.4 - How should settings be accessed by dialogs (and other classes in 
general)?

T1.1 - Realization of the settings structure the way we decided in Q1.3
T1.2 - Realization of the interface for other classes to access the 
settings the way it was decided in Q1.4
T1.3 - InDE settings dialog using interface from T1.2



2. InDE project dialog and config structure
-------------------------------------------
Having done this we will be able to discuss about which way we will 
design our SCons scripts
will be organized after this.

Q2.1 - Which variables / options might be needed? (We partly have done 
this already)
Q2.2 - In which sections should they be divided?
Q2.3 - How should the project configuration be stored in the MainWindow 
class?
Q2.4 - How should the project configuration be access by other classes?

Note: Q2.3 and Q2.4 may be easily answered when Q1.3 and Q1.4 are done.

T2.1 - Realization of the project config structure the way we decided to 
in Q2.3
T2.2 - Realization of the interface discussed in Q2.3
T2.3 - "Create new project" dialog
T2.4 - "Project settings" dialog



3. SCons scripts
----------------
This means we will discuss some general questions about their structure 
and what things we
need to realize in them in order to fit most (not: all) thinkable projects.

Q3.1 - Do we want to split the SConstruct files by platform (e.g. 
SConscript.linux, SConscript.win32 and so on)?
Q3.2 - Do we want to support SConscripts in subdirectories - would it be 
to complicated? (perhaps we shouldn't think about this as long as we 
don't support subprojects)
Q3.3 - Probably on of the most difficult questions: If we want to 
support single file compilation (on saving/button click), how may SCons 
do this?

T3.1 - Writing standard SConstructs/SConscripts for targets (executable, 
shared or static library, MSVC project, ...)



--
Of course we aren't done after this. Further steps will be introduced 
after steps 1 or 2 are done.

Jannis

Ok, this will be a perfect start.
I am too tired to work things out this evening. Just had a few very
short nights.

But some ideas related to the other mail, regarding project settings.

Project creation. Anjuta has a nice concept with its project creation
dialog (or at least had as i looked at it last time - over a one and a
half year ago). Step by Step dialogs wich let the user enter project
name, description, target, project type, used libraries, both normal
ones and user libraries.

For project settings i like the way Eclipse shows you the information.

The on demand compilation should be done without SCons. We know the
project settings, because we create them and let the user change them
through one of our dialogs. So we know all of the compiler settings. So
we can easily invoke the compiler with all needed switches, the input
file and path and also output path. The only problem i see at this
moment may be to know which compiler to use, because SCons does this job
for us. But maybe we can use a very basic SConscipt file to just test
the compiler version to parse which compiler is chosen by SCons and use
this one.

I'll give all the answers a try tomorrow. And i also think we should
start implementing project and inde settings as soon as we collected
some ideas / information. It should not be too difficult to edit
settings and add new variables once the basic structure is implemented.
Also the supported project types can easyly enhanced as we know of new
needs.
I do not like to think too far in such detailed questions as long as it
is unclear anyhow, how to introduce the basic features to the
application. Doing one step after the other should clear things up and
show the problems or the potential of the solution.

BTW, when we are just talking about project settings. A nice thing i
like in many IDE is the automatic license header creation. Maybe a
radiogroup of few known free licenses (at least GPL and LGPL) and maybe
one for user defined header. If you push the new file button, the header
will automatically added with license, year and author.
And, if we create a *.cpp or *.h file, InDE could ask the user to create
the other file, too. So you only have to create the header file, InDE
creates the source file too. And therefor maybe a long term feature:
after the header is written, InDE could add all not inlined functions as
simple bodies to the cpp file, so that you only have to enter your code
(just for the roadmap of nice features;)

I just looked through the tasks and i think you can attach the following
task to me (as i am not allowed to do this):
1612: Create project dialog, as it depends on 1611 anyhow

Is it neccessary to divide the single tasks to subprojects? They all
depend on the InDE core and so it may be more intuitiv to have them in
one list.

Hi Jochen.

For some hours I have been testing nearly all downloadable content 
management systems but none of them
did satisfy me. This means our site will be static XHTML. I already know 
this is be what you had
preferred anyway so why not? Besides, the FOX website is static, too and 
it seems to be no problem.
Most of the stuff provided by CMS would totally bloat the site, I think.

Well then, I have been developing websites for the last six years, so 
I'll make a layout and present
it to you as soon as I can. Only if you agree with this. If not, feel 
free to make a layout by your-
self and I am going to have a look at it when it's done.

So far so good. What we sooner or later need for a website (and for the 
application itself) is a kind
of logo. If you agree, I will ask my girlfriend whom I am going to visit 
next week. She's really
experienced in vector graphics, perhaps she has a good idea.

Ah, it's late once again. Today's roadmap announce gives me the hope 
that you now have the
possibility to follow my - often a little chaotic - thoughts. That's a 
good feeling.

Regards,
Jannis

Step by step, yes, that would be great. You could use FXWizard for this, 
I think.
But let's not head on too fast. We should discuss the internal structure 
of the InDE settings
first and follow the roadmap: One task after the other. At least that's 
what I think.

That sounds really good. I see the same problem as you here: the 
compiler which is used.
As we are using Python already with SCons we perhaps could put a little 
Python script for on
demand compilation into the project directory. Therewith, platform and 
what else is needed to
know could be determined and the right compiler command could be called.

It's a bit vague at the moment but I'm optimistic we will be able to 
manage this.

ALL the answers? Answering only the questions for the first step might 
be better. Just tell
me what your ideas on the first four questions are. I will start a new 
mailinglist topic
for Q1.1 - Q1.4.

If we find a good solution for managing the setting variables adding 
more options will be easy, yes.

Yeah. Let's work in a systematic step-by-step schema - the roadmap is 
predestinated for that.

No, it's not. But I'm not sure if we really need this task management 
feature. What do you think?
Wouldn't clearly marked topics in this mailinglist (such as: 
"[InDE-devel] [T1.1] Some text") be
enough? We are only two developers, if we follow a scheme like this, 
there'd be enough structure.

BTW: Do you have ICQ, IRC or something? Such logistic questions perhaps 
could be more easily
discussed there.

Message-ID: <42100A12.3030309@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

Loads of stuff below, as you can see. This is a suggestion for the InDE 
settings dialog structure (inspired by Anjuta, mostly).
It's not complete (how should it?). I suppose there will be tons of 
options which we will have to add sooner or later. Once having
a good settings structure that should be easy. The options below could 
make a tiny start. Here we go.


+------------------------+
| General                |
+------------------------+

+ Base directory
+ History:
    + Amount of recently opened projects
    + Amount of recently opened files
+ Options:
    + Automatically load last project

+------------------------+
| Saving                 |
+------------------------+

+ Autosave interval (0 = no autosave)
+ Backup on save
    + Backup-Suffix

+------------------------+
| Editor                 |
+------------------------+

+ Use auto indentation
    + Indentation style
+ Use tabs
+ Tab size
+ Many more - the editor widgets will be complicated, let's first do 
some more simple stuff.

Jannis

Subject: [InDE-devel] [Q1.3, Q1.4] How should settings be stored in the MainWindow class?
Message-ID: <42100D8F.2070104@sten-net.de>

I thought of something like this:

We don't need an extra class for the settings. Some nested structs 
should do it.

As an example:

    struct EditorSettings;
    struct BuildSettings;
    struct GeneralSettings;
    struct SavingSettings;

Following the mailinglist topic for Q1.1 and Q1.2, GeneralSettings could 
look like this:

    struct GeneralSettings
    {
        FXString   baseDir;
        FXuint     numRecentProjects;
        FXuint     numRecentFiles;
        FXbool     autoLoadProject;
    };

In addition to this we could define a settings struct including all 
other structs:

    struct InDESettings
    {
        EditorSettings    editor;
        BuildSettings     build;
        GeneralSettings   general;
        SavingSettings    saving;
    };

MainWindow would then have member variable

    InDESettings   settings;

and - perhaps, if this wouldn't slow down the app - some FXDataTargets 
pointing
to import setting options.

This member variable could be passed as pointer to all widgets which 
need access
to it, like e.g.:

    settingsDialog = new SettingsDialog(this, _("InDE settings"), 
&settings);

This would make application-wide use and changing of the settings easy 
and is easily
maintainable and uncomplicated.

For the project settings we could use something similar which will be 
filled with
values from the project.cfg file. But that is another question in 
another step (Q2.3
and Q2.4, I think).

Jochen, do you agree with this suggestion or do you have a different idea?

Regards,
Jannis

Some improvement:

Let's only add settings we already are able to use. For example, we 
don't have an editor widget yet, so what reason is there to
think about what we could somehow need for it? That's too vague.

So it would be better to answer Q1.3 and Q1.4 and then realize the 
settings system including only options we can already make
use of.

Anyhow, this will be my task while yours will be the project creating 
dialog and the internal project config structure. We should
discuss about that as soon as we have found a solution for Q1.3 and Q1.4 
which both of us believe in.

Jannis

Hm. Q1.* is InDE Settings. This shouldn't be too important. Yes, we need
the very basics there, like project directory, but what else? The
project settings are more important as i think.

I like the taskmanagers. One can add the features and / or ideas, mark
it with a certain priority and so you can see all needed work at one
site. Having this only at the mailinglist may force us to forget a
feature.
Also others can see where the development will lead to.
The discussion of single topics, yes, for this is the mailinglist.

Long long time ago.....
I will have a look if i found my acount or i will get a new one (it was
at least 5 years back as i used icq). I haven't needed it in the past.
So what do you prefer?

That's similar to my idea. I maybe had added functions to flush and load
the settings.

Info: Name, Description, Target, maybe Target machine and OS?( do we
need crosscompilation option? does any compiler other than gcc support
this?), Version(here?)
Path and Libs: self speaking
Switches: several compiler switches, like debug switch, optimization,
warnings,...

Sections as you described in "project configuration file" mail plus the

what about SConscript files in the src directory?
We need them for subprojects, yes, so do we want to enable them in
general? This question may be answered as soon as we implement the
creation of them and see what may fit best.

If you read my latest mail on Q1.1/1.2 you could see I noticed this, 
too. Base directory at the moment
is all we need. Yet, some structure should be predefined. If you do the 
project settings, I'll work
on this.

Okay, we will use the taskmanagers, then. I'll give it a new structure 
and assign the project
settings dialog to you.

Fine. Of course, load and save functions are needed as well.
With a settings structure like this we now have a good starting point 
for the first dialogs.
Feel free to work the project settings dialog. I will add this to the 
task manager on berliOS.

Correct. I will set up some setting options but we still have to wait

to appear in order to know which ones we really need.

I thought about two more variables: project include dir, project source 
dir (perhaps in plural form)
This would mean the user can define two (or more) directories for this 
which will automatically included
in a central SConstruct file. This would make SConscripts in the source 
directory redundant.

What do you think? Would this be usefull?

I am not familiar with SCons on Windows, too. But I will have a look at 
that soon. I develop with FOX
on Win32 as well as on Linux - that's why I want something like a MSVS 
project export function.

This probably will require some extra discussion. But lets make the

Subject: [InDE-devel] Major problem on passing settings struct to dialogs/widgets
Message-ID: <4210B31B.1090102@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

I am working on the settings dialog at the moment and I noticed a major 
problem we would ran into if we passed
our settings structs (both, project and InDE) to every dialog/widget:

Whenever a dialog changes a settings option (e.g. 
settings->editor.colors.foreColor = FXRGB(0, 0, 0)), every
widget will still have to update its state. Normally this would be done 
by onUpd... and onCmd... but we can't use them
this way if the input fields of our dialogs aren't by a selector 
connected to such functions. That means
we would have to update each widgets state manually (Unthinkable!).

The much more effective solution would look like this (you can see this 
in Adie):

- MainWindow has all variables in our structs (loading and storing them 
will be as easy as before).

- MainWindow has a two methods for each variable, like e.g.:
    MainWindow::onUpdTextForeColor
    MainWindow::onCmdTextForeColor

- These functions are connected with a selector, like e.g.:
    MainWindow::ID_TEXTFORECOLOR

- every dialog / widget can use these selectors to read or change the 
variables, like e.g.:
    new FXColorWell(matrix, FXRGB(0,0,0), getParent(), 
MainWindow::ID_TEXTFORECOLOR)

That would do it. We will have to design many a dialog and widget so we 
should use this for rapid development.
Of course the effort for adding a settings option to MainWindow will be 
a little higher. Yet, I think we have
to do it this way.

What are your thoughts about it? Perhaps you could take a look into 
Adie's Preferences.cpp and TextWindow.cpp.
Adie stores all options directly in the TextWindow object - but we still 
could use our structs in order to
give them a little more structure.

Regards,
Jannis

Hi Jochen.

I've commited my partly done SettingsDialog together with a new header 
file called InDESettings.h to SVN.

The SettingsDialog uses the Adie-like mechanism to access InDE's 
settings. In my opinion that's the way we should
access the settings values. I added a function to retrieve the main 
settings struct as well - you'll need this for creating
the project directory. It's called MainWindow::getSettings()

For the project settings structure I'd suggest you create a 
ProjectSettings.h with all structs in it.

If you use FXWizard for your project creating dialog, please call it 
"NewProjectWizard". If you want to use
FXDialogBox or something else, call it "NewProjectDialog".

What else do I have to say? Hm, I'm looking forward to having a look on 
your project dialog. Perhaps you could write
another one for the project settings (this could be inspired by the 
SettingsDialog) after that? You'd have to add loads of methods
to the MainWindow class for this, but they will be very useful.

I have to try to catch my train ...

Regards,
Jannis

which means: src dir for *.cpp, include dir for *.h, but then a bin dir
for the *.o files would also help ;)

Let me do a proposal:
Let us forget about the Windows structures first. I guess, we should
start implementing InDE-settings, project-settings, Editor widget, and
SCons support for Linux.
If this all works well, we can see what is done under Windows to get
this run too. If it runs, also with lilitations (e.g. only with
gcc-mingw), we should release InDE 0.0.1 to get the audience. Then we
can develop more features step by step. 
So WE can see the progress of this project.

What about something like this:

struct InDE_Settings {
	int loadSettings();
	int saveSettings();
}

struct EditorSettings: public InDE_Settings {
	Font *font;
	//...
}

int EditorSettings::loadSettings() {
	//...
}
(or implementing those functions in the base settings struct and take
the path and file as params)
doing it this way may provide a clear settings API

It seems to be the easiest solution.
I am not too familiar to fox by now, i guess you know it better than me.

It doesn't change anything.

BTW, i needed several new builds until i saw your settings dialog. I
didn't want to appear until something unknown happened. Maybe my
selfbuild FOX Debain package is a bit fluffy - but i can't imagine,
because it mainly copies the needed files to the needed location. Weird.

Maybe this has to do with the header files of InDE.
I tried to pack all includes into one file ("InDE.h") so all other files 
only needed this one. Perhaps
that's not a good solution. I noticed that sometimes the SCronscript 
senselessly rebuilt all files
and sometimes did ignore one or two. As soon as you have commited your 
project creating dialog
to SVN I'll change the inclusion structure.

Message-ID: <42122F86.8020802@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

I sent a feature request to Jeroen concerning the FXDirList. We could 
use FXDirList for our ProjectBrowser but first someone
has to implement a function to define the root directory for this class. 
I hope Jeroen is willing to do this. He can't expect everyone
wants to have a directory listing with / (or all drives) as root element(s).

Next point: I probably will be able to commit an Editor class which 
supports browsing documents with the help of tabs and a toggleable
fixed tab for immediate document view (like it is in Adie) as well. I 
already had done most of it during my first tests for InDE and I think
it won't be too difficult to merge it with our current code.

That's it for now.

Regards,
Jannis

I've actually added my latest changes. If you want to update the include
structure and merge the editor widget, it will be easy to syncronize our
versions.

BTW, svn should allow us to change the same files and keep track of it -
as long as we do a svn update before svn commit. I haven't seen svn
behavior about this, but cvs behavior and i guess it won't differ too
much.

>>>>>>>>>>>>> old version
// old code...
<<<<<<<<<<<<< new version
// new code...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>

or something similar should mark the dirty areas. You just have to merge
it with your changed version and upload the new revision.

BTW, it seems i have some problems with trunk/.sconsign.dblite while
uploading. What is this file good for. Seems to be a (binary?) version
of SCons watching what has changed and what has to be build on next
call. If so, i guess it should be moved to attic.

Hi Jannis.

i actually completed the GUI of the NewProjectWizard. The saving of the
settings is still pending and also an optional picture for the wizard.

I thought long about the arrangement of the compiler switches and how to
add libraries to the settings.
I decided to keep it very simple for the first iteration and therefor
opened a new task to remind us to implement a more intelligent and
straightforward system sometimes later.

More to come tonight ;)

Sounds great. I'll have a look at that soon (= as soon as my softmodem

Jeroen did agree with my feature request. This means we won't have much 
work with the project file browser. Perhaps this gives us the
possibility to think about an additional class browser. But that's not 
easy so we should wait with that.

It should be able to do that, yes. I'm download the SVN version control 
documentation at the moment
and I will search for a feature like this in it.

If SVN is able to ignore files, we could ignore it. It is allways 
created when SCons is executed.
Since after changes SCons normally should have to recompile nearly 
everything we don't need
it in SVN.

But this feature will go into 1.5. However, I wanted to stay at 1.4 but
if it's needed.... ;)
I thought about something different, but haven't looked at it yet.
Something like a virtual snapshot of the devel filesystem -> we do not
need to show every files in it to the user, as they may be totally
uninteresting. As far as a project config script exists, we know which
files are in these directories and are needed by the project.

I will have a look at this next days, if you are not totally
uninterested in it.

Of course, this would be interesting. Yet, I'm not sure how to observe 
the filesystem permanently
to redraw when files/directories are deleted/moved/created. FXDirList 
does this automatically.
And it allows to use a filter for file extensions. We could apply a 
filter based on the project configuration
to FXDirList and wouldn't have to use a virtual filesystem.
I'm not sure about that. But if you are willing to look into that, why not?

I thought of a simple FXList, not a FXList.
Building the directories specyfied in the project config and showing the
files added to the project.

For the first iteration we only need the cpp an h source files, maybe
later on some resource files,...

This could be done with a simple FXList, where we keep record of the
contents based on the project.cfg. Al list entries store the file path
and can be opened by (bouble)clicking on them.

I guess, objectfiles, libraries, SCons files,.... aren't important for
the uses, hence we can add them by uncluding filters.

You're right, this would do the job. Nevertheless, that would require at 
least FXTreeList if we wanted
to separate source and include directories. But why not go for FXDirList 
and FOX 1.5?
When the first stable version of InDE is ready to be announced I think 
FOX might already be at 1.6. If this
sounds quite pessimistic - it isn't. There is really much to do, I don't 
suppose InDE 0.0.1 is going to be
finished before autumn 2005. And what's more important: FOX 1.5 is 
likely to bring some features we really
need - like internationalization and theming.

With FXDirList we had no work on the functions being responsible for 
deleting and moving files. I know
other IDEs work with a virtual filesystem - so does Anjuta and I hated 
adding each file I wanted to see in
the project file view manually.

To come to an end: For the first release I don't consider a virtual file 
view a good solution.

Right, these things aren't import for the normal user. Only for InDE to 
compile the project.

Subject: [InDE-devel] Dialog conventions
Message-ID: <4214FED8.3010003@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

As I've already mentioned, I'm currently developing a standardized way 
to write dialogs. I had a deep look into your
NewProjectWizard and added some checking functionality and improved it's 
internal design a bit. I'm doing the
same with SettingsDialog as well. This still takes some time but I will 
be finished by the end of the week, I think.

After rewriting these two dialogs I will compose some conventions about 
Dialogs. Afterwards we should follow these
in order to have a kind-of-standardized internal look including the 
already mentioned checking mechanism and easy
access to all values of the dialog. I think it's a good thing.

BTW: I already extended your dialog (or better to say, MainWindow) by 
the functionality to create the project directory,  to
fill the project config with values from NewProjectWizard, to save and 
close an already opened project and, finally, to
open the new project. And I wrote a function to select a project from 
the filesystem and open it. Wasn't that difficult.

So far,
Jannis

Sorry, I meant FXTreeList.
Ok, why not. Why not using a development version for development? 

One point for the stable branch would be, that the development isn't
bothered by API changes. But on the other hand porting to 1.6 might be a
pain...

Ah, I think we have a very different view of releasing... I'll open a
new thread for the discussion on it to get a little structure to the ML.

One reason for a virtual file system would be that the project holds all
files that are in the project. If a user copies a file to the project
directory and we do however not recognize this file being included by
SCons, this may cause some strange behavior and may be hard to
reintroduce, if we once follow another strategy.

Actually we have a tab with two books: file system and project view. As
long as we implement a context menu for the file system view, that lets
you add a file to the project, there are no problems. The user can add
every file he wants without pain. If he wants to see a file which isn't
included in the project, he also has the possibility because there is
the file system view. And if he can open a file from there, no
frustration will happen...

I think, a treelist is not really difficult to implement. Why not doing
it - at least until the setRootDirectory() is in FOX 1.5. And after
that, it may be a setting, the user can do: see the complete content in
the project directory or see the stripped project view. This enables
some flexibility.

If Jeroen introduces the new development tree in the next few days with
this feature implemented, i may change my opinion in a second... ;)

Hi.

The discussion about the release cycles, as mentioned before...

First, you are absolutly right: fox 1.5 will long expected features,
that i really would like to add, like the mentioned internationalization
and thememing.

But what speaks against early and regularly releases? I don't see any
point against early releases, as far as we stay in a development tree
and do not have to include bug eleminating patches to probably old
versions.

There are many points, why I'd like to release early and regularly:
* increased audience
* maybe new killer features
* bug reports for bugs we haven't seen yet
* maybe some help on special topics, like e.g. cvs and svn support
* as long as the IDE is usable as a simple editor, it is a benefit to
the free software users
* we only check in running version to svn, however, every check in could
(theoretically) be a development snapshot numbered as a release. as soon
as we think some cool new features are implemented, we show our users,
that the development is still going on and they stay to use InDE
* it is definetly self-motivation to see a (increasing) number of users
use what you've done....

Just my 2 Cents

Can you check in your code? Or at least parts of it?
I just wanted to go on with development. There are some important things
missing, that i wanted to add. Also the checking and pre-filling of the
structs should be implemented this night ;)
And i wanted to build the project.cfg, implementing the read and write

Okay, this point (the idea of one real filesystem and one virtual 
filesystem) definitively goes to you.
But ... adding a file to the project view still would be complicated 
somehow  (two or three mouseclicks
plus browsing the filesystem and selecting a file).

Concerning the project files used by SCons we speek of two different 
things - at least I suppose we do.
I thought about this: We use the directories defined in the project 
directory settings to collect the files we
need for the SCons script. That means: All *.cpp, *.c or *.cc files in 
the source dir and all *.h, *.hpp files
in the include dir. This would spare observing these directories 
permanently. Every file copied/moved to
or removed from them would directly be visible in the FXDirList and also 
used by the SCons script.

Thus, no unexpected problems would occur since there are directories 
clearly marked as source, header
and build directories.

How is your opinion?

Regards,
Jannis

Hello Jochen.

Your absolutely right so I correct myself. Why not release earlier than 
I thought about first.
Increased audience and visible active development aren't bad. Some help 
would be great, too.

In other words: I agree with you. I'm not that familiar with SVN 
(although I'll teach myself some basics
next week) so committing only running versions might be a good choice. 
Perhaps we could run a little
internal SVN server (I have a virtual debian server running on which we 
could do this: www.gezeiten.org) to
share our code. Only development snapshots would be released to the 
official SVN and to our website.

That's a good thing perhaps.

Nevertheless, as long as InDE has development status we should use FOX 1.5.

Best regards,
Jannis

Sorry, I don't wanted to steal your tasks, really. I just tested some 
ways to check a dialog and yours
was the only one that was already finished (more or less). I found a 
good way to do this and I will
introduce it to you this weekend.
Until now we hadn't any conventions and thus, our dialogs differed in 
many points. This is what I
want to prevent. With the "rules" I am defining at the moment our future 
dialogs will not differ
that much and they will all be structured the same way (this is going to 
spare *much* work when
merging our code).

Following these rules, our dialogs's structures will allways look the 
same and no adjustments will
have to be made.

Sorry again, I hope that is ok for you.

Regards,
Jannis

That's true as long as no files *not* in the project dir are included to
the project.

I think you misunderstood the point.

We have a svn directory, why setting up another one?

Only checking in running versions means, that you only check in changed
files, which you know of that they compile fine and that the code is
running. Bugs, well, who writes large amount of code without bugs? But
the version should compile and run. That is not for the users, but for
the other developers, as they most probably work on another module and
do not want to fix your code, that you had checked in not completely.

If you follow this rule: often check in little changes, every check in
compiles and is runnable (or not used by other code), doesn't lead to
problems in the repository and also other developers can eventually
share your code.

So every nightly build tarball (does berlios support this?) is runnable.
That means, if you think, there have been many chages to the repository,
many cool new features, check out - or take your actual workspace
(better to commit first) make a scons -c , cd .. , tar cfvz ..... and
upload it as a new release...

Forgot to mention, that i'd prefer to release the very first release
0.0.1 as soon as the editor is running (in a simple way) and the project
configuration works.
So the users may have a feeling, where this projects goes to.

Ah, ok. Yes, I misunderstood your words. Now it's much clearer to me.

It's a good idea to work with SVN that way.

Okay. For that we need to finish an editor widget (I'm working on this 
at the moment) and InDE
will have to be able to open/close/save single files and projects. This 
won't be too much work, I
think so we should be able to announce 0.0.1 by the end of the month - 
if not earlier.

What else has to be implemented for 0.0.1?

Hi Jochen.

Why should someone's project depend on files somewhere else in the 
filesystem? The only reason
might be libraries but they are already handled by our project settings 
and SCons.

If someone wants to use a source/header file for his project it's only 
logical to put it into the project directories.

Or did I misunderstood you once more?

Jannis

I read this in the Xfce4-dev mailinglist recently:

"We have basicly two branches, HEAD and xfce_4_2. HEAD is the 
development branch, where you can break things, and which will result in 
4.4.0. xfce_4_2 is the stable branch which gets only bugfixes, and from 
which maintaince releases for 4.2 will be made."

I don't know whether we are able to create two directories in our main 
SVN but I suppose this is possible. So this perhaps would be a fine 
solution once we have a stable program: One development tree and one for 
the stable version which only gets bugfixes. What do you think?

Regards,
Jannis

Hey ;)
I believe that we do not have to implement special features for special
releases. I also believe, going on as planned will do best.
As soon as the editor, the single file and project opening and saving
works, InDE is usable - although it may not be very comfortable or
powerfull. But you can use it.
If we implement something until then it is ok. But i think implementing
features only for this release should not be our concern. As soon as
another nice feature is implemented and working, we could release 0.0.2
and so on. Just for the user to see the progress and for our motivation
if you see the download numbers and eventually get feedback.

My thoughts about releasing are to proceed step by step, doing what has
to be done and releasing as soon as you think it might be of interest.
But not working for single releases but for the complete system.
It will be different for the version 1.0.0 where you will have finished
several features and the stability should be there. But not for the
development line before.

Just my 2 Cents ( as this fits more accurately than 5 years ago *g*)

Hey, good Morning.

You're right. As soon as file/project opening/saving works we can 
release 0.0.1 (or should we say
0.1.0?).

Yes, that's the way version control works. There are two things here:
TAGS and BRANCHES.
If you check in a revision of your code that seems to be a milestone or
noteworthy in any other way, e.g. first check in of a new feature, you
can give that revision a Tag. So, if you later want to see history or
check out the initial version of this feature,... then you do not have
to remember the revision number (maybe something like rev. 2763) but the
Tag. Say you import initial version with cvs support your Tag may be
called CVS. So to find the cvs add, you just have `svn CVS checkout` to
find it again.
The other things are branches. If you add a branch, it is initially just
a copy of the source of data. For example you are releasing InDE 1.0.0
then you might set a new branch called STABLE. This branch is for the
maintanance of the stable line, the normal svn (mostly called HEAD) tree
is the development tree.
If you find a bug in the stable version and you want to fix it, you can
fix it in the stable version (without changing the development version).

This may be not the best example. Actually you see the branches in more
detail in libgcj. They use the HEAD branch for normal library
development and the GUI branch for special development concerning the
GUI classes - this are AWT and Swing. Actually they are merging those
branches to get the GUI features beack to the mainline. 
This may be of some interest, if you fear that work on special parts of
you system may force changes in other parts, but which are under heavy
development for other features. So you can develop you things in your
branch (here GUI) without concerning about the ongoing development in
the main branch. As soon as you think your work is done or fits the
needs and stability criteria and you may wish to add it to the main
branch, you just merge it in.

And just another word to the repository and the branches. SVN and CVS do
not really save files, the change diff history files. Yes, the first
check in of a file and the diff are quasi the same. But later on for a
new revision there is only a very little diff file to be stored, instead
of a (possible very large) file. The version control stores every
revision of every file, so this method saves you lot of storage
capacity.
Based on this, opening a new branch is not a real copy, but just a link
to a certain revision of a file. The two trees now have the same code
base, but differ in future change history.

Hope, things get a bit clearer now.... if not, feel free to ask.

This is and must be possible.
I think branches will not only be the tool of choice for maintaining
stable versions, but may also be very important for several larger
features, that may have the need to change more fundamental things in
the (whole) project code.

To get things even more clear, look at the graph for gcc versions:
http://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html down at calender. There you see the main
development line and different branches. This seems to fit for InDE,
too, although in a not so large tree.

This is something i have thought about, too. As it seems, we use the GNU
way of version numbering (even for stable, odd for unstable), we had to
call it 0.1.0
On the other hand it is a preliminary release.... 

But you're right, calling it 0.1 would be the right way to follow our
(internal) release number convention. All following releases will then
be called 0.1.1, 0.1.2, 0.1.3,....

Holla.

I have restructured our SVN. We now have:

trunk/
tags/
branches/

trunk/ is the development directory where stuff is commited to, normally.

tags/ is going to be the base directory for releases. Examples: 
tags/0.1, tags/0.2 ... and some day tags/1.0

branches/ could be used if we wanted to test and implement certain 
features without completely rewriting
the actual codebase and so on.

--

I have commited the new, better codebase to SVN. Jochen, if you want to 
implement a project settings dialog
you can get inspirations from SettingsDialog. NewProjectWizard can't use 
the access methods you wrote since
there might already be a project opened. But the rewritten 
NewProjectWizard can of course be seen as a standard
way to write dialogs without direct access to the settings structures 
(see the dialogs specs regarding this).

So far,
Jannis

BTW: Jochen, as long as you don't add *.o, .sconsign.dblite and the InDE

I don't know whether .sconsign.dblite will have to be deleted each time 
you run "svn update" in trunk in order to build InDE correctly afterwards.

We'll see.

What about a very basic project home website in this layout style. At
least a very basic site with a few comments about the project and some
(maybe dead) links for the first iteration. I guess, everything selfmade
is better than the berlios-not-yet-uploaded website.

BTW, i like the layout since it looks very similar to my intranet at
home ;)

As far as i've understood the tags and branches, we can use tha tags for
the development snapshot releases (0.1.x, 0.2.x), but should open new
branches for the stable releases, to integrate bugfixes without changing
the code base

Yes, i know. i hadn't cared about the data. I wanted to build up the GUI
in the first iteration and thinking about what else is needed, before
going to implement the data connections.
But that was the work, that you've done before i had any chance.

Hi Jannis.

MainWindow::onCmdProjectLoadConfig does not load all config entries.
Didn't you complete the load function or did you have something in mind?

Hi Jochen.

I hoped you like it. I already created most pages of the website as well 
as a navigation structure
and so on. A basic design (in the vein of this specs document) is 
already done. I will upload
it later today.

Yes, might be better. I'm not sure which one to use for development 
snapshots and which one
for releases. I read the subversion book at 
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/index.html (especially
the part about tags and branches is interesting). Perhaps you could have 
a look at that, too.

I've already done that, but the 1.1 version
Regarding to it, we can use the tags for the development
snapshots/versions.
But for stable releases, branches may be better, as far as only tested
features from the development brnach will come to it as new versions.

Just to mention before uploading: please make sure, the files are owned
by the group or have rw-rw-r-- rights permissions, so that i have a

As far as i don't know the details you're working on, this hint may be a
shot in the blue.... but

Have you had a look at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/fxscintilla/ ?
This may be a very interesting widget for our editor as it will do some
of the work we plan to implement. So why do it twice and introduce
unneeded bugs, if this does exactly what we want.

It also may not be what you desire, then just throw away this hint...

Jupp, i've noticed this morning.
I really like the design!
BTW, every single file has the last change date from february 2004 -
hey, we already are in 2005 ;)
I will have a look if i can change it this night - or tomorrow evening,

If it does, that would indeed be a pro of FXScintilla. At least, we could use it until we have something better.

Erm, I noticed something like this on my local webserver but ... I thought of having corrected it. If you haven't done that yet, I will do it immediately.

Yes, great. And I will have a look into FXScintilla once again. May take some time but after having a project settings dialog and good editor widgets we would be able to release a first development snapshot.

Hi Jochen.

I only wanted to let you know that I'm heavily working on the tabbed 
editor as well as on the text edit widget.

Already done:
    - Additional settings option settings.editor.font (I added this to 
the InDE settings dialog as well)
    - Tab context menu (like it is in Firefox/Mozilla) with options "New 
Tab", "Close", "Close others", "Close all".
      These options actually work.
    - Fix document view (without sense at the moment, perhaps this 
feature will be removed)
    - Files can be opened by double clicking on an item in the 
filesystem/project browser
    - Dummy function for saving the file

Things I'm still working on:
    - Undo list for each file opened
    - setModified() method that is called every time the text content of 
a file is changed in the editor
    - saving of a file (depends on previous problem)
    - Context menu for filesystem/project browser

I will commit these changes as soon as the things I'm still working on 
are done.

Best regards,
Jannis

Nice to hear things evolve that fast!

I've added two things to the project faq this morning: the license and
the meaning of the name. The faq.html now contains the link targets ;)

BTW, I am working at the project settings dialog by now and will
complete it this evening.

As far as I am learning the whole day things are going on very slow :(

I also hope to find the time to start implementing the projectFS
tomorrow, maybe starting tonight.... if it's done i come back to the
project settings to implement the new file feature.
What about the inclusion of the #ifndef FILE_H #define FILE_H for the
headers? I think it would be a nice to have feature.

Seems like the first development snapshot isn't far away anymore.

Good to hear. The editor stuff is a lot of work. Maybe I can finish it 
until next weekend (there
are some basics I'm not sure how to implement them yet).

New file feature? Do you mean a menu command to create a source/header 
file?

We could provide three menu commands for this:
    1. New file (Ctrl+N) for a new tab named "Untitled"
    2. New file (Ctrl+Shift+N - or something different) for a dialog 
where one could select the
       type of the file (source, header, other...)
    3. New class (Ctrl+Shift+C) for a dialog where the user can add 
methods. This dialog could
       create either a header/source file pair (if project is a C/C++ 
project) or one file with
       the class sceleton (if project is a script language like Ruby or 
Python)

Is this what you meant with "new file feature"?

Hi Jochen.

I had a look at it already. Very good. You even noticed the button 
paddings and
used them for your buttons. That's great.

So far,
Jannis

BTW, perhaps we should remove the project type (C/C++, Ruby, Python, 
...) as far as we don't have
a stable source. C/C++ will allways have highest priority and adding 
project support for other
languages will be much easier as soon as we have a little more 
experience. Don't you think?

Something like this. I haven't thought in detail about this, but
imagined something like this (kind of eclipse new file / class / ...).
And basically adding the license header to every new file! That's why i
included author, email, license and license header if no standard
license (GPL, LGPL by now, more to come like CPL, MPL,...)

And here we also could add the #ifndef ... #define ... skeleton for the
header files.

As another feature here i thought about something like this:
if you choose to add a new source or header file, you get a little
dialog box, which asks you to enter the file's name and shows you a
check box, which means to also add the new corresponding file
(header/source). So you only need to define the new header and get the
source as well or vice versa. I liked that in Diasce2.

Although i like an early release, i prefer the debian way: it is
finished if it's finished ;)

But keeping the project type box. I don't mind deleting it or having it
without functionality in this early state.

I see. Okay, sounds good so far.

Ah, ok. We could by default use the basename of the file (e.g. by using 
FXFile::name()) in upper
case letters plus _H (examples: MAINWINDOW_H, MYDIALOG_H). That's the 
easiest way.
Another idea would be to add an underscore in front of each upper case 
letter in the filename
(examples: MainWindow.h => MAIN_WINDOW_H, MyDialog.h => MY_DIALOG_H). I 
don't know
how easy detecting those upper case letters is.
For InDE we use the first method.

Jepp. Hehe. That's it.

You're right. Now that we have prepared all variables and functions for 
this option it would be stupid
to remove it, just to add it again some day in the same way we already did!

We'll keep it then, but we won't make any use of it until we are ready 
for implementing support for
other languages.
