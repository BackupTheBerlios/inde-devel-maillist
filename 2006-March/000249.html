Personally, I don't feel the need for a better editor/IDE anymore. I
got used to gvim and wouldn't want to use an editor not featuring
things like separate edit/write modes etc. anmore.

Having said this, I should probably mention that the only thing I'm
really missing in gvim is project management. There are attempts to
integrate it into the user interface, but all of them are almost
unusable.

If I would want to write an IDE again, I'd write a project manager
and code browser and would try to embed vim, like e.g.
<A HREF="http://pida.berlios.de/">http://pida.berlios.de/</A> does.

&gt;<i> If you, Jannis, don't like or have not the time, i will understand

</I>
I'm very happy with gvim. The few tasks I have to do outside of it
(like SVN and project management) are not worth so much hours of work,
I think. But feel free to reactivate the project - I'll watch the
progress and contribute to it again if I feel like doing so. But this
is rather unlikely to happen.

BTW, good luck with your diploma!

Regards,
Jannis
