<PRE>Hi Jannis.

The point goes to you ;)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> You're right. I'd like to correct myself. Lets keep it simple using the 
</I>&gt;<i> project name (without numbers) as
</I>&gt;<i> directory and nothing else.
</I>Ok.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Subprojects ... Hm, that's difficult stuff, I guess. I'd like to hold 
</I>&gt;<i> off on this until we have a stable
</I>&gt;<i> code base which means a program that actually works without subprojects.
</I>&gt;<i> Once we have reached that point we could still think about implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> subprojects. It's an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting idea indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I do not think it is too difficult. But you're right, this is a feature
for future versions. We actually should care about the very basics.
&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I understand. I know it seems a bit as if I would try to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> dozends of tasks all at one
</I>&gt;<i> time without having a clear mind or something. Hehe.
</I>
No, that's not what i meant. It is a bit easier for me to see what is to
be done and where to start and what's related to it if i had seen any
code ;)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No problem. That's good as long as we turn them into something 
</I>&gt;<i> constructive (I think that is
</I>&gt;<i> what we do).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes. And i personally like roadmaps. They do not only help others to see
what will be included in future versions, but help yourself storing all
ideas in a central area. Others may add good ideas if they know what you
will produce, join the discussion or just increase the audience. But
primary intention is to keep the own ideas.
