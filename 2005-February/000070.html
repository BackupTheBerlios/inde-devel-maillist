</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The discussion about the release cycles, as mentioned before...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>When the first stable version of InDE is ready to be announced I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>think FOX might already be at 1.6. If this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>sounds quite pessimistic - it isn't. There is really much to do, I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>suppose InDE 0.0.1 is going to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>finished before autumn 2005. And what's more important: FOX 1.5 is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>likely to bring some features we really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>need - like internationalization and theming.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>First, you are absolutly right: fox 1.5 will long expected features,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that i really would like to add, like the mentioned internationalization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and thememing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But what speaks against early and regularly releases? I don't see any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>point against early releases, as far as we stay in a development tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and do not have to include bug eleminating patches to probably old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There are many points, why I'd like to release early and regularly:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* increased audience
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* maybe new killer features
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* bug reports for bugs we haven't seen yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* maybe some help on special topics, like e.g. cvs and svn support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* as long as the IDE is usable as a simple editor, it is a benefit to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the free software users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* we only check in running version to svn, however, every check in could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(theoretically) be a development snapshot numbered as a release. as soon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>as we think some cool new features are implemented, we show our users,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that the development is still going on and they stay to use InDE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* it is definetly self-motivation to see a (increasing) number of users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>use what you've done....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Forgot to mention, that i'd prefer to release the very first release
</I>&gt;<i>0.0.1 as soon as the editor is running (in a simple way) and the project
</I>&gt;<i>configuration works.
</I>&gt;<i>So the users may have a feeling, where this projects goes to.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay. For that we need to finish an editor widget (I'm working on this 
at the moment) and InDE
will have to be able to open/close/save single files and projects. This 
won't be too much work, I
think so we should be able to announce 0.0.1 by the end of the month - 
if not earlier.

What else has to be implemented for 0.0.1?

Regards,
Jannis
