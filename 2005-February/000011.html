<PRE>Hi Jannis.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The user creates a project and defines name and version number for it.

</I>&gt;<i> this directory a
</I>&gt;<i> project configuration file (let's call it &quot;project.ini&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;project.cfg&quot;) is placed by InDE.
</I>&gt;<i> All project settings (divided into severeal sections - see my last mail) 
</I>&gt;<i> are written into
</I>&gt;<i> this file.
</I>Hm. I do not like InDE-0.0.1 as you have to create a new project for a
new version.
It were ok, if you only defined InDe-0.0 and the patchlevel is the build
target. But, both ways, will restrict the users to follow our release
numbering scheme.

Before discussing this in more detail, another demand, as i believe we
should include.
Take a compiler project for example. The compiler project may be divided
into a preprocesor subproject, a parser (or many, e.g. to support many
languages like gcc) subproject, and last but not least the targets
subprojects (i386, ppc, mipsel,...).
So you will create one project, named compiler, and several subproject,
named parser, preprocessor, target,... they all will build as objects
(libs) and build together with several rules to a complete compiler.
So you need to create subprojects, which will be handled as severel
directories in the IDE and will build at once, if you push the build
project button. And you may specify several subprojects to be included
or not for the build target (e.g. preprocessor + cpp-parser +
target-amd64)

I'd prefer it to have the subprojects (if any) named with the main
version numbers, not the base project. So you may specify the workplace
version-dependend and for example fix bugs in the stable branch while
you normally develop in the unstable branch. This also would require a
diff and merge tool to integrate code from one branch into the other.
This also is in need for a new subproject, but this could be handled
like this: subproject -&gt; new version tree -&gt; get new version number -&gt;
based on old version number -&gt; inDe creates new subdirectory/subproject
and copies the files from the base to the new directory. But, taking fox
versions as base, the subproject's version directories are named
fox-1.4, the patchlevel is then used for the new build target for a
release build.

And maybe you could include something like Make's make distcheck, wich
throws out an ready to ship tar.gz, which also could be easyly archived,
working together with a archive old branch function.

The above way to handle projects and version numbers relies on a
straightforward SConsript file tree, but is easyly supported by SCons.

What do you think about this project structure?

&gt;<i> That's it. Perhaps there will be some more files besides project.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> which have to be initially put into the project directory like e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> SConstructs or something like this. We'll see.
</I>project.cfg and SConscript will be all files needed. And the SConstruct
file in the major project dir.


&gt;<i> If you don't have ideas about import configuration sections/variables
</I>&gt;<i> for project.cfg, I'll create the &quot;Create new project&quot; dialog. This will
</I>&gt;<i> be a first example of how the other dialogs could be designed and how
</I>&gt;<i> they could be integrated into the main window class. That having done
</I>&gt;<i> I will be able to share the code via SVN so we can discuss about the
</I>&gt;<i> next steps.
</I>That's not the problem....
I am just thinking about how to contribute. What do you actually expect?
If i should implement just the advanced setting class, i do not need any
InDE code, because it's a standalone class derived from fox.
But implementing the create new dialog based on the settings class will
need the code base to include it.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any objections?
</I>More than enough.
&gt;<i> 
</I>Later
