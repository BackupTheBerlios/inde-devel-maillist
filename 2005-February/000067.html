</I>I think you misunderstood the point.

We have a svn directory, why setting up another one?

Only checking in running versions means, that you only check in changed
files, which you know of that they compile fine and that the code is
running. Bugs, well, who writes large amount of code without bugs? But
the version should compile and run. That is not for the users, but for
the other developers, as they most probably work on another module and
do not want to fix your code, that you had checked in not completely.

If you follow this rule: often check in little changes, every check in
compiles and is runnable (or not used by other code), doesn't lead to
problems in the repository and also other developers can eventually
share your code.

So every nightly build tarball (does berlios support this?) is runnable.
That means, if you think, there have been many chages to the repository,
many cool new features, check out - or take your actual workspace
(better to commit first) make a scons -c , cd .. , tar cfvz ..... and
upload it as a new release...
