</I>Ok, this will be a perfect start.
I am too tired to work things out this evening. Just had a few very
short nights.

But some ideas related to the other mail, regarding project settings.

Project creation. Anjuta has a nice concept with its project creation
dialog (or at least had as i looked at it last time - over a one and a
half year ago). Step by Step dialogs wich let the user enter project
name, description, target, project type, used libraries, both normal
ones and user libraries.

For project settings i like the way Eclipse shows you the information.

The on demand compilation should be done without SCons. We know the
project settings, because we create them and let the user change them
through one of our dialogs. So we know all of the compiler settings. So
we can easily invoke the compiler with all needed switches, the input
file and path and also output path. The only problem i see at this
moment may be to know which compiler to use, because SCons does this job
for us. But maybe we can use a very basic SConscipt file to just test
the compiler version to parse which compiler is chosen by SCons and use
this one.

I'll give all the answers a try tomorrow. And i also think we should
start implementing project and inde settings as soon as we collected
some ideas / information. It should not be too difficult to edit
settings and add new variables once the basic structure is implemented.
Also the supported project types can easyly enhanced as we know of new
needs.
I do not like to think too far in such detailed questions as long as it
is unclear anyhow, how to introduce the basic features to the
application. Doing one step after the other should clear things up and
show the problems or the potential of the solution.

BTW, when we are just talking about project settings. A nice thing i
like in many IDE is the automatic license header creation. Maybe a
radiogroup of few known free licenses (at least GPL and LGPL) and maybe
one for user defined header. If you push the new file button, the header
will automatically added with license, year and author.
And, if we create a *.cpp or *.h file, InDE could ask the user to create
the other file, too. So you only have to create the header file, InDE
creates the source file too. And therefor maybe a long term feature:
after the header is written, InDE could add all not inlined functions as
simple bodies to the cpp file, so that you only have to enter your code
(just for the roadmap of nice features;)

I just looked through the tasks and i think you can attach the following
task to me (as i am not allowed to do this):
1612: Create project dialog, as it depends on 1611 anyhow

Is it neccessary to divide the single tasks to subprojects? They all
depend on the InDE core and so it may be more intuitiv to have them in
one list.
