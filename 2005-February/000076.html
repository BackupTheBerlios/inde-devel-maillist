Yes, that's the way version control works. There are two things here:
TAGS and BRANCHES.
If you check in a revision of your code that seems to be a milestone or
noteworthy in any other way, e.g. first check in of a new feature, you
can give that revision a Tag. So, if you later want to see history or
check out the initial version of this feature,... then you do not have
to remember the revision number (maybe something like rev. 2763) but the
Tag. Say you import initial version with cvs support your Tag may be
called CVS. So to find the cvs add, you just have `svn CVS checkout` to
find it again.
The other things are branches. If you add a branch, it is initially just
a copy of the source of data. For example you are releasing InDE 1.0.0
then you might set a new branch called STABLE. This branch is for the
maintanance of the stable line, the normal svn (mostly called HEAD) tree
is the development tree.
If you find a bug in the stable version and you want to fix it, you can
fix it in the stable version (without changing the development version).

This may be not the best example. Actually you see the branches in more
detail in libgcj. They use the HEAD branch for normal library
development and the GUI branch for special development concerning the
GUI classes - this are AWT and Swing. Actually they are merging those
branches to get the GUI features beack to the mainline. 
This may be of some interest, if you fear that work on special parts of
you system may force changes in other parts, but which are under heavy
development for other features. So you can develop you things in your
branch (here GUI) without concerning about the ongoing development in
the main branch. As soon as you think your work is done or fits the
needs and stability criteria and you may wish to add it to the main
branch, you just merge it in.

And just another word to the repository and the branches. SVN and CVS do
not really save files, the change diff history files. Yes, the first
check in of a file and the diff are quasi the same. But later on for a
new revision there is only a very little diff file to be stored, instead
of a (possible very large) file. The version control stores every
revision of every file, so this method saves you lot of storage
capacity.
Based on this, opening a new branch is not a real copy, but just a link
to a certain revision of a file. The two trees now have the same code
base, but differ in future change history.

Hope, things get a bit clearer now.... if not, feel free to ask.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether we are able to create two directories in our main 
</I>&gt;<i> SVN but I suppose this is possible. So this perhaps would be a fine 
</I>&gt;<i> solution once we have a stable program: One development tree and one for 
</I>&gt;<i> the stable version which only gets bugfixes. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is and must be possible.
I think branches will not only be the tool of choice for maintaining
stable versions, but may also be very important for several larger
features, that may have the need to change more fundamental things in
the (whole) project code.

To get things even more clear, look at the graph for gcc versions:
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html</A> down at calender. There you see the main
development line and different branches. This seems to fit for InDE,
too, although in a not so large tree.
