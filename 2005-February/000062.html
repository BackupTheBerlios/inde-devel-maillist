</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I've already mentioned, I'm currently developing a standardized way 
</I>&gt;<i> to write dialogs. I had a deep look into your
</I>&gt;<i> NewProjectWizard and added some checking functionality and improved it's 
</I>&gt;<i> internal design a bit. I'm doing the
</I>&gt;<i> same with SettingsDialog as well. This still takes some time but I will 
</I>&gt;<i> be finished by the end of the week, I think.
</I>
Can you check in your code? Or at least parts of it?
I just wanted to go on with development. There are some important things
missing, that i wanted to add. Also the checking and pre-filling of the
structs should be implemented this night ;)
And i wanted to build the project.cfg, implementing the read and write
functionality and add a menu to open an existing project, adding
files,...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After rewriting these two dialogs I will compose some conventions about 
</I>&gt;<i> Dialogs. Afterwards we should follow these
</I>&gt;<i> in order to have a kind-of-standardized internal look including the 
</I>&gt;<i> already mentioned checking mechanism and easy
</I>&gt;<i> access to all values of the dialog. I think it's a good thing.
</I>
To have conventions - definetly yes!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: I already extended your dialog (or better to say, MainWindow) by 
</I>&gt;<i> the functionality to create the project directory,  to
</I>&gt;<i> fill the project config with values from NewProjectWizard, to save and 
</I>&gt;<i> close an already opened project and, finally, to
</I>&gt;<i> open the new project. And I wrote a function to select a project from 
</I>&gt;<i> the filesystem and open it. Wasn't that difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Oh, that was what i had planed for this night.... hm, thought it was my
job...
ok, i am going to another project of mine, as far as i cannot do
anything by now....

Jochen
