<PRE>I thought of something like this:

We don't need an extra class for the settings. Some nested structs 
should do it.

As an example:

    struct EditorSettings;
    struct BuildSettings;
    struct GeneralSettings;
    struct SavingSettings;

Following the mailinglist topic for Q1.1 and Q1.2, GeneralSettings could 
look like this:

    struct GeneralSettings
    {
        FXString   baseDir;
        FXuint     numRecentProjects;
        FXuint     numRecentFiles;
        FXbool     autoLoadProject;
    };

In addition to this we could define a settings struct including all 
other structs:

    struct InDESettings
    {
        EditorSettings    editor;
        BuildSettings     build;
        GeneralSettings   general;
        SavingSettings    saving;
    };

MainWindow would then have member variable

    InDESettings   settings;

and - perhaps, if this wouldn't slow down the app - some FXDataTargets 
pointing
to import setting options.

This member variable could be passed as pointer to all widgets which 
need access
to it, like e.g.:

    settingsDialog = new SettingsDialog(this, _(&quot;InDE settings&quot;), 
&amp;settings);

This would make application-wide use and changing of the settings easy 
and is easily
maintainable and uncomplicated.

For the project settings we could use something similar which will be 
filled with
values from the project.cfg file. But that is another question in 
another step (Q2.3
and Q2.4, I think).

Jochen, do you agree with this suggestion or do you have a different idea?

Regards,
Jannis
