<PRE>Hi.

The discussion about the release cycles, as mentioned before...

&gt;<i> When the first stable version of InDE is ready to be announced I
</I>&gt;<i> think FOX might already be at 1.6. If this
</I>&gt;<i> sounds quite pessimistic - it isn't. There is really much to do, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> suppose InDE 0.0.1 is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> finished before autumn 2005. And what's more important: FOX 1.5 is 
</I>&gt;<i> likely to bring some features we really
</I>&gt;<i> need - like internationalization and theming.
</I>
First, you are absolutly right: fox 1.5 will long expected features,
that i really would like to add, like the mentioned internationalization
and thememing.

But what speaks against early and regularly releases? I don't see any
point against early releases, as far as we stay in a development tree
and do not have to include bug eleminating patches to probably old
versions.

There are many points, why I'd like to release early and regularly:
* increased audience
* maybe new killer features
* bug reports for bugs we haven't seen yet
* maybe some help on special topics, like e.g. cvs and svn support
* as long as the IDE is usable as a simple editor, it is a benefit to
the free software users
* we only check in running version to svn, however, every check in could
(theoretically) be a development snapshot numbered as a release. as soon
as we think some cool new features are implemented, we show our users,
that the development is still going on and they stay to use InDE
* it is definetly self-motivation to see a (increasing) number of users
use what you've done....

Just my 2 Cents
	Jochen
