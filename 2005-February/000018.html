<PRE>Q = questions =&gt; discussion =&gt; decision
T = tasks



1. InDE settings dialog and structure
-------------------------------------
This will be very import for nearly every one of the other classes.

Q1.1 - Which variables / options might be needed?
Q1.2 - In which sections should they be divided?
Q1.3 - How should settings be stored in the MainWindow class?
Q1.4 - How should settings be accessed by dialogs (and other classes in 
general)?

T1.1 - Realization of the settings structure the way we decided in Q1.3
T1.2 - Realization of the interface for other classes to access the 
settings the way it was decided in Q1.4
T1.3 - InDE settings dialog using interface from T1.2



2. InDE project dialog and config structure
-------------------------------------------
Having done this we will be able to discuss about which way we will 
design our SCons scripts
will be organized after this.

Q2.1 - Which variables / options might be needed? (We partly have done 
this already)
Q2.2 - In which sections should they be divided?
Q2.3 - How should the project configuration be stored in the MainWindow 
class?
Q2.4 - How should the project configuration be access by other classes?

Note: Q2.3 and Q2.4 may be easily answered when Q1.3 and Q1.4 are done.

T2.1 - Realization of the project config structure the way we decided to 
in Q2.3
T2.2 - Realization of the interface discussed in Q2.3
T2.3 - &quot;Create new project&quot; dialog
T2.4 - &quot;Project settings&quot; dialog



3. SCons scripts
----------------
This means we will discuss some general questions about their structure 
and what things we
need to realize in them in order to fit most (not: all) thinkable projects.

Q3.1 - Do we want to split the SConstruct files by platform (e.g. 
SConscript.linux, SConscript.win32 and so on)?
Q3.2 - Do we want to support SConscripts in subdirectories - would it be 
to complicated? (perhaps we shouldn't think about this as long as we 
don't support subprojects)
Q3.3 - Probably on of the most difficult questions: If we want to 
support single file compilation (on saving/button click), how may SCons 
do this?

T3.1 - Writing standard SConstructs/SConscripts for targets (executable, 
shared or static library, MSVC project, ...)



--
Of course we aren't done after this. Further steps will be introduced 
after steps 1 or 2 are done.

Regards,
Jannis
