<PRE>Hi Jochen.

I am working on the settings dialog at the moment and I noticed a major 
problem we would ran into if we passed
our settings structs (both, project and InDE) to every dialog/widget:

Whenever a dialog changes a settings option (e.g. 
settings-&gt;editor.colors.foreColor = FXRGB(0, 0, 0)), every
widget will still have to update its state. Normally this would be done 
by onUpd... and onCmd... but we can't use them
this way if the input fields of our dialogs aren't by a selector 
connected to such functions. That means
we would have to update each widgets state manually (Unthinkable!).

The much more effective solution would look like this (you can see this 
in Adie):

- MainWindow has all variables in our structs (loading and storing them 
will be as easy as before).

- MainWindow has a two methods for each variable, like e.g.:
    MainWindow::onUpdTextForeColor
    MainWindow::onCmdTextForeColor

- These functions are connected with a selector, like e.g.:
    MainWindow::ID_TEXTFORECOLOR

- every dialog / widget can use these selectors to read or change the 
variables, like e.g.:
    new FXColorWell(matrix, FXRGB(0,0,0), getParent(), 
MainWindow::ID_TEXTFORECOLOR)

That would do it. We will have to design many a dialog and widget so we 
should use this for rapid development.
Of course the effort for adding a settings option to MainWindow will be 
a little higher. Yet, I think we have
to do it this way.

What are your thoughts about it? Perhaps you could take a look into 
Adie's Preferences.cpp and TextWindow.cpp.
Adie stores all options directly in the TextWindow object - but we still 
could use our structs in order to
give them a little more structure.

Regards,
Jannis
