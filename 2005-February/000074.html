</I>Hey ;)
I believe that we do not have to implement special features for special
releases. I also believe, going on as planned will do best.
As soon as the editor, the single file and project opening and saving
works, InDE is usable - although it may not be very comfortable or
powerfull. But you can use it.
If we implement something until then it is ok. But i think implementing
features only for this release should not be our concern. As soon as
another nice feature is implemented and working, we could release 0.0.2
and so on. Just for the user to see the progress and for our motivation
if you see the download numbers and eventually get feedback.

My thoughts about releasing are to proceed step by step, doing what has
to be done and releasing as soon as you think it might be of interest.
But not working for single releases but for the complete system.
It will be different for the version 1.0.0 where you will have finished
several features and the stability should be there. But not for the
development line before.

Just my 2 Cents ( as this fits more accurately than 5 years ago *g*)
