<PRE>Hi Jochen.

&gt;&gt;<i>Of course it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>will appear in some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>kind of global settings dialog.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ok. This may placed in ~/.foxrc/InDE
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Personally, I don't like ~/.foxrc/InDE. There's more sense in creating an
own program directory in the home dir. There may be some other things
besides user settings (e.g. user specific syntax file) and it would be
too chaotic if they were spread to ~/.foxrc/InDE and ~/.InDE.

&gt;&gt;<i>The user creates a project and defines name and version number for it. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>InDE will then create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a project directory which includes both (e.g. InDE-0.0.1 or FOX-1.4). In 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this directory a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>project configuration file (let's call it &quot;project.ini&quot; or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;project.cfg&quot;) is placed by InDE.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>All project settings (divided into severeal sections - see my last mail) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are written into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hm. I do not like InDE-0.0.1 as you have to create a new project for a
</I>&gt;<i>new version.
</I>&gt;<i>It were ok, if you only defined InDe-0.0 and the patchlevel is the build
</I>&gt;<i>target. But, both ways, will restrict the users to follow our release
</I>&gt;<i>numbering scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You're right. I'd like to correct myself. Lets keep it simple using the 
project name (without numbers) as
directory and nothing else.

&gt;<i>Before discussing this in more detail, another demand, as i believe we
</I>&gt;<i>should include.
</I>&gt;<i>Take a compiler project for example. The compiler project may be divided
</I>&gt;<i>into a preprocesor subproject, a parser (or many, e.g. to support many
</I>&gt;<i>languages like gcc) subproject, and last but not least the targets
</I>&gt;<i>subprojects (i386, ppc, mipsel,...).
</I>&gt;<i>So you will create one project, named compiler, and several subproject,
</I>&gt;<i>named parser, preprocessor, target,... they all will build as objects
</I>&gt;<i>(libs) and build together with several rules to a complete compiler.
</I>&gt;<i>So you need to create subprojects, which will be handled as severel
</I>&gt;<i>directories in the IDE and will build at once, if you push the build
</I>&gt;<i>project button. And you may specify several subprojects to be included
</I>&gt;<i>or not for the build target (e.g. preprocessor + cpp-parser +
</I>&gt;<i>target-amd64)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd prefer it to have the subprojects (if any) named with the main
</I>&gt;<i>version numbers, not the base project. So you may specify the workplace
</I>&gt;<i>version-dependend and for example fix bugs in the stable branch while
</I>&gt;<i>you normally develop in the unstable branch. This also would require a
</I>&gt;<i>diff and merge tool to integrate code from one branch into the other.
</I>&gt;<i>This also is in need for a new subproject, but this could be handled
</I>&gt;<i>like this: subproject -&gt; new version tree -&gt; get new version number -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>based on old version number -&gt; inDe creates new subdirectory/subproject
</I>&gt;<i>and copies the files from the base to the new directory. But, taking fox
</I>&gt;<i>versions as base, the subproject's version directories are named
</I>&gt;<i>fox-1.4, the patchlevel is then used for the new build target for a
</I>&gt;<i>release build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And maybe you could include something like Make's make distcheck, wich
</I>&gt;<i>throws out an ready to ship tar.gz, which also could be easyly archived,
</I>&gt;<i>working together with a archive old branch function.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, creating a tar.gz or tar.bz2 (which I prefer) will be easy with 
SCons. I'll add this to the build script.
An archiving function for these dist-files should be no problem, too.

&gt;<i>The above way to handle projects and version numbers relies on a
</I>&gt;<i>straightforward SConsript file tree, but is easyly supported by SCons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What do you think about this project structure?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Subprojects ... Hm, that's difficult stuff, I guess. I'd like to hold 
off on this until we have a stable
code base which means a program that actually works without subprojects.
Once we have reached that point we could still think about implementing 
subprojects. It's an
interesting idea indeed.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>That's it. Perhaps there will be some more files besides project.cfg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which have to be initially put into the project directory like e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>SConstructs or something like this. We'll see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>project.cfg and SConscript will be all files needed. And the SConstruct
</I>&gt;<i>file in the major project dir.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If you don't have ideas about import configuration sections/variables
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for project.cfg, I'll create the &quot;Create new project&quot; dialog. This will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be a first example of how the other dialogs could be designed and how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>they could be integrated into the main window class. That having done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I will be able to share the code via SVN so we can discuss about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>next steps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's not the problem....
</I>&gt;<i>I am just thinking about how to contribute. What do you actually expect?
</I>&gt;<i>If i should implement just the advanced setting class, i do not need any
</I>&gt;<i>InDE code, because it's a standalone class derived from fox.
</I>&gt;<i>But implementing the create new dialog based on the settings class will
</I>&gt;<i>need the code base to include it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, I understand. I know it seems a bit as if I would try to handle 
dozends of tasks all at one
time without having a clear mind or something. Hehe.

Well then, I will meditate some minutes about the next steps in order to 
provide you some
clear information about what is to be done.

&gt;&gt;<i>Any objections?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>More than enough.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No problem. That's good as long as we turn them into something 
constructive (I think that is
what we do).

Regards,
Jannis
