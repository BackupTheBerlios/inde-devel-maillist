<PRE>Hi again.

&gt;<i>One reason for a virtual file system would be that the project holds all
</I>&gt;<i>files that are in the project. If a user copies a file to the project
</I>&gt;<i>directory and we do however not recognize this file being included by
</I>&gt;<i>SCons, this may cause some strange behavior and may be hard to
</I>&gt;<i>reintroduce, if we once follow another strategy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually we have a tab with two books: file system and project view. As
</I>&gt;<i>long as we implement a context menu for the file system view, that lets
</I>&gt;<i>you add a file to the project, there are no problems. The user can add
</I>&gt;<i>every file he wants without pain. If he wants to see a file which isn't
</I>&gt;<i>included in the project, he also has the possibility because there is
</I>&gt;<i>the file system view. And if he can open a file from there, no
</I>&gt;<i>frustration will happen...
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, this point (the idea of one real filesystem and one virtual 
filesystem) definitively goes to you.
But ... adding a file to the project view still would be complicated 
somehow  (two or three mouseclicks
plus browsing the filesystem and selecting a file).

Concerning the project files used by SCons we speek of two different 
things - at least I suppose we do.
I thought about this: We use the directories defined in the project 
directory settings to collect the files we
need for the SCons script. That means: All *.cpp, *.c or *.cc files in 
the source dir and all *.h, *.hpp files
in the include dir. This would spare observing these directories 
permanently. Every file copied/moved to
or removed from them would directly be visible in the FXDirList and also 
used by the SCons script.

Thus, no unexpected problems would occur since there are directories 
clearly marked as source, header
and build directories.

How is your opinion?

Regards,
Jannis
