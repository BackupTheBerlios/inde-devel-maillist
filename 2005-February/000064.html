</I>Hello Jochen.

Your absolutely right so I correct myself. Why not release earlier than 
I thought about first.
Increased audience and visible active development aren't bad. Some help 
would be great, too.

In other words: I agree with you. I'm not that familiar with SVN 
(although I'll teach myself some basics
next week) so committing only running versions might be a good choice. 
Perhaps we could run a little
internal SVN server (I have a virtual debian server running on which we 
could do this: www.gezeiten.org) to
share our code. Only development snapshots would be released to the 
official SVN and to our website.

That's a good thing perhaps.

Nevertheless, as long as InDE has development status we should use FOX 1.5.

Best regards,
Jannis
