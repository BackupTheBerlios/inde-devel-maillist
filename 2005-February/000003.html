</I>Hi Jochen.

FOX 1.4.3 was released today.

Yes, it seems as if 1.4 is not that stable as one might have expected. 
Yet, Jeroen did some
important fixes in 1.4.2 and 1.4.3. 1.4.3 to me seems to be as good as 
the latest development
release although I'll use the latter to develop my stuff.

By the way, if he had released it as 1.3.90 he wouldn't have followed 
the naming scheme
of FOX (the last number defines the amount of patches which were 
released after the
1.3.0 release).

Regards,
Jannis
