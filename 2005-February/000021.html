<PRE>Hi Jochen.

For some hours I have been testing nearly all downloadable content 
management systems but none of them
did satisfy me. This means our site will be static XHTML. I already know 
this is be what you had
preferred anyway so why not? Besides, the FOX website is static, too and 
it seems to be no problem.
Most of the stuff provided by CMS would totally bloat the site, I think.

Well then, I have been developing websites for the last six years, so 
I'll make a layout and present
it to you as soon as I can. Only if you agree with this. If not, feel 
free to make a layout by your-
self and I am going to have a look at it when it's done.

So far so good. What we sooner or later need for a website (and for the 
application itself) is a kind
of logo. If you agree, I will ask my girlfriend whom I am going to visit 
next week. She's really
experienced in vector graphics, perhaps she has a good idea.

Ah, it's late once again. Today's roadmap announce gives me the hope 
that you now have the
possibility to follow my - often a little chaotic - thoughts. That's a 
good feeling.

Regards,
Jannis
