<PRE>Hi Jochen.

</I>&gt;<i>But some ideas related to the other mail, regarding project settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Project creation. Anjuta has a nice concept with its project creation

</I>&gt;<i>half year ago). Step by Step dialogs wich let the user enter project
</I>&gt;<i>name, description, target, project type, used libraries, both normal
</I>&gt;<i>ones and user libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Step by step, yes, that would be great. You could use FXWizard for this, 
I think.
But let's not head on too fast. We should discuss the internal structure 
of the InDE settings
first and follow the roadmap: One task after the other. At least that's 
what I think.

&gt;<i>The on demand compilation should be done without SCons. We know the
</I>&gt;<i>project settings, because we create them and let the user change them
</I>&gt;<i>through one of our dialogs. So we know all of the compiler settings. So
</I>&gt;<i>we can easily invoke the compiler with all needed switches, the input
</I>&gt;<i>file and path and also output path. The only problem i see at this
</I>&gt;<i>moment may be to know which compiler to use, because SCons does this job
</I>&gt;<i>for us. But maybe we can use a very basic SConscipt file to just test
</I>&gt;<i>the compiler version to parse which compiler is chosen by SCons and use
</I>&gt;<i>this one.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That sounds really good. I see the same problem as you here: the 
compiler which is used.
As we are using Python already with SCons we perhaps could put a little 
Python script for on
demand compilation into the project directory. Therewith, platform and 
what else is needed to
know could be determined and the right compiler command could be called.

It's a bit vague at the moment but I'm optimistic we will be able to 
manage this.

&gt;<i>I'll give all the answers a try tomorrow. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ALL the answers? Answering only the questions for the first step might 
be better. Just tell
me what your ideas on the first four questions are. I will start a new 
mailinglist topic
for Q1.1 - Q1.4.

&gt;<i>And i also think we should
</I>&gt;<i>start implementing project and inde settings as soon as we collected
</I>&gt;<i>some ideas / information. It should not be too difficult to edit
</I>&gt;<i>settings and add new variables once the basic structure is implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>Also the supported project types can easyly enhanced as we know of new
</I>&gt;<i>needs.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If we find a good solution for managing the setting variables adding 
more options will be easy, yes.

&gt;<i>I do not like to think too far in such detailed questions as long as it
</I>&gt;<i>is unclear anyhow, how to introduce the basic features to the
</I>&gt;<i>application. Doing one step after the other should clear things up and
</I>&gt;<i>show the problems or the potential of the solution.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah. Let's work in a systematic step-by-step schema - the roadmap is 
predestinated for that.

&gt;<i>BTW, when we are just talking about project settings. A nice thing i
</I>&gt;<i>like in many IDE is the automatic license header creation. Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i>radiogroup of few known free licenses (at least GPL and LGPL) and maybe
</I>&gt;<i>one for user defined header. If you push the new file button, the header
</I>&gt;<i>will automatically added with license, year and author.
</I>&gt;<i>And, if we create a *.cpp or *.h file, InDE could ask the user to create
</I>&gt;<i>the other file, too. So you only have to create the header file, InDE
</I>&gt;<i>creates the source file too. And therefor maybe a long term feature:
</I>&gt;<i>after the header is written, InDE could add all not inlined functions as
</I>&gt;<i>simple bodies to the cpp file, so that you only have to enter your code
</I>&gt;<i>(just for the roadmap of nice features;)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Superb ideas!

&gt;<i>I just looked through the tasks and i think you can attach the following
</I>&gt;<i>task to me (as i am not allowed to do this):
</I>&gt;<i>1612: Create project dialog, as it depends on 1611 anyhow
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is it neccessary to divide the single tasks to subprojects? They all
</I>&gt;<i>depend on the InDE core and so it may be more intuitiv to have them in
</I>&gt;<i>one list.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, it's not. But I'm not sure if we really need this task management 
feature. What do you think?
Wouldn't clearly marked topics in this mailinglist (such as: 
&quot;[InDE-devel] [T1.1] Some text&quot;) be
enough? We are only two developers, if we follow a scheme like this, 
there'd be enough structure.

BTW: Do you have ICQ, IRC or something? Such logistic questions perhaps 
could be more easily
discussed there.

Regards,
Jannis
