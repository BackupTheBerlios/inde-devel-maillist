Ok, why not. Why not using a development version for development? 

One point for the stable branch would be, that the development isn't
bothered by API changes. But on the other hand porting to 1.6 might be a
pain...

&gt;<i> When the first stable version of InDE is ready to be announced I think

</I>
Ah, I think we have a very different view of releasing... I'll open a
new thread for the discussion on it to get a little structure to the ML.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With FXDirList we had no work on the functions being responsible for 
</I>&gt;<i> deleting and moving files. I know
</I>&gt;<i> other IDEs work with a virtual filesystem - so does Anjuta and I hated 
</I>&gt;<i> adding each file I wanted to see in
</I>&gt;<i> the project file view manually.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To come to an end: For the first release I don't consider a virtual file 
</I>&gt;<i> view a good solution.
</I>
One reason for a virtual file system would be that the project holds all
files that are in the project. If a user copies a file to the project
directory and we do however not recognize this file being included by
SCons, this may cause some strange behavior and may be hard to
reintroduce, if we once follow another strategy.

Actually we have a tab with two books: file system and project view. As
long as we implement a context menu for the file system view, that lets
you add a file to the project, there are no problems. The user can add
every file he wants without pain. If he wants to see a file which isn't
included in the project, he also has the possibility because there is
the file system view. And if he can open a file from there, no
frustration will happen...
&gt;<i> 
</I>I think, a treelist is not really difficult to implement. Why not doing
it - at least until the setRootDirectory() is in FOX 1.5. And after
that, it may be a setting, the user can do: see the complete content in
the project directory or see the stripped project view. This enables
some flexibility.

If Jeroen introduces the new development tree in the next few days with
this feature implemented, i may change my opinion in a second... ;)
