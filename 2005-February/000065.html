<PRE>Hi Jochen.

&gt;&gt;<i>BTW: I already extended your dialog (or better to say, MainWindow) by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the functionality to create the project directory,  to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>fill the project config with values from NewProjectWizard, to save and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>close an already opened project and, finally, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>open the new project. And I wrote a function to select a project from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the filesystem and open it. Wasn't that difficult.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Oh, that was what i had planed for this night.... hm, thought it was my
</I>&gt;<i>job...
</I>&gt;<i>ok, i am going to another project of mine, as far as i cannot do
</I>&gt;<i>anything by now....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Jochen
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sorry, I don't wanted to steal your tasks, really. I just tested some 
ways to check a dialog and yours
was the only one that was already finished (more or less). I found a 
good way to do this and I will
introduce it to you this weekend.
Until now we hadn't any conventions and thus, our dialogs differed in 
many points. This is what I
want to prevent. With the &quot;rules&quot; I am defining at the moment our future 
dialogs will not differ
that much and they will all be structured the same way (this is going to 
spare *much* work when
merging our code).

Following these rules, our dialogs's structures will allways look the 
same and no adjustments will
have to be made.

Sorry again, I hope that is ok for you.

Regards,
Jannis
