<PRE>'n Abend,

&gt;&gt;<i>For the first iteration we only need the cpp an h source files, maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>later on some resource files,...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This could be done with a simple FXList, where we keep record of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>contents based on the project.cfg. Al list entries store the file path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and can be opened by (bouble)clicking on them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>You're right, this would do the job. Nevertheless, that would require at 
least FXTreeList if we wanted
to separate source and include directories. But why not go for FXDirList 
and FOX 1.5?
When the first stable version of InDE is ready to be announced I think 
FOX might already be at 1.6. If this
sounds quite pessimistic - it isn't. There is really much to do, I don't 
suppose InDE 0.0.1 is going to be
finished before autumn 2005. And what's more important: FOX 1.5 is 
likely to bring some features we really
need - like internationalization and theming.

With FXDirList we had no work on the functions being responsible for 
deleting and moving files. I know
other IDEs work with a virtual filesystem - so does Anjuta and I hated 
adding each file I wanted to see in
the project file view manually.

To come to an end: For the first release I don't consider a virtual file 
view a good solution.

&gt;&gt;<i>I guess, objectfiles, libraries, SCons files,.... aren't important for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the uses, hence we can add them by uncluding filters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>Right, these things aren't import for the normal user. Only for InDE to 
compile the project.

Regards,
Jannis
