Hi Jannis.

I just read the internationalization is growing in the new fox
development tree..... seems like we can start to look for translators
after our first release ;)

Although i haven't had the nerves to code last two days i used some time
today to read a bit and think some things over.
Have you yet supported ctags for the editor widget?

I have the idea to implement a class browser based on ctags. For we are
using ctags for syntax highlighting, it should be only minimal work to
add a class browser based on the same data. And BTW, without knowing
what you are actually coding, we should think about a timer or a certain
event to actualize the ctags file for project data.

Also i thought about displaying multiple projects in InDE. After
completing the projehct browser, i will have a look at this. I think it
is a very easy enhancement but with great benefit.

sincerly
	Jochen

Hi Jannis.

Do you know of a simple StringTokenizer in Fox? Or do i have to code it
myself based on substrings or regex?

Do you remember we talked about a mail from me that seemed not to arrive 
to the mailinglist? I wrote
something about ctags there but that mail is gone, so lets start this 
topic here.

We can use ctags for autocompletion and the class browser. For 
syntaxhighlighting this won't be too
interesting but perhaps we could find out class names that appear in the 
project and highlight them.

I haven't coded the last days, too but I looked at a program called 
"ReZound". That's an audio editor
written in FOX. After having seen their code I could imange to implement 
some backend classes for
tasks like periodically updating the project's ctags file and so on. The 
goal is to take some code out
of MainWindow since it would grow too large otherwise.

We could probably divide the code maintainance. If I'm responsible for 
the editor widget, syntaxhighlighting
and so on it would only be logical to do the class browser. Whereas you 
were responsible for
project management and, lets say, the build instructions. Just an idea, 
yet I don't know if you agree.

project settings structure in MainWindow.
Maybe we will have to rewrite it in order to store them in a list. I 
think we should still wait with it.

It was just a comment from Jeroen that he's working on it. I haven't had
a look at it yet, but believe the next devel version may include the
first steps.

Yes, that's sensefull. And if you want to do the class browsing .... ;)

The central project settings aren't the problem for managing several
projects at once, i think. Storing them in a list and asking for the
actual one should fit. This could easily done by the project browser.

MainWindow is really growing fast. Maybe Jeroen may help us out with
some tricks how we can manage to distribute the functionality to some
classes without loosing the ability to update the settings and widgets
as easily as we do it now.

Subject: [InDE-devel] garbage collector?
Message-ID: <1109856610.1557.32.camel@jogix.sojox>

Hi Jannis.

I have a problem and don't know why :(

I am working on the project browser. This is a class, which includes a
FXTreeList.

The FXTreeList is initialized in the constructor of ProjectBrowser and
deleted in the destructor.

The FXTreeItems are build dynamically in several functions.

If i close InDE, i get a segmentation fault, while deleting
projectBrowser in MainWindow's destructor. If i comment that line out,
everythings seems fine (?). Debugging into ProjectBrowser's destructor
tells me, that everything works fine there.

Why do i get the segmentation fault while deleting projectBrowser?

What about the FXTreeItems? As long as they are part of FXTreeList, they
are deleted with FXTreeList like in control of a garbage collector?

Any hints?

regards
	Jochen

It's so close to the autocompletion due to some ctags parsing and so on 
that it won't be too difficult,
I think.

Yes, storing all projects in a list is clear so far.

I just saw an article in the FOX Wiki - 
http://fox-toolkit.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Cookbook/Iterating_Over_Entries_In_FXSettings 
-
which could be interesting. This could probably replace all the 
"onUpdSetting..." and "onCmdSetting..."
functions and our settings structs as well. Just a few methods for 
reading, writing the settings and
some for handling certain option changes would remain. Maybe this could 
spare a lot of code and make
it easier to read.

Hm, no I cannot help you on that at the moment. I know those problems 
but experimenting with
the destructor and the objects deleted in it nearly allways led to the 
solution.

I just didn't call the constructor of the superclass, so the destructor
called the destructor of the superclass, which wasn't constructed.
Hard to find error.... ;)

The question is, do we need iterating?
But reading only those sections at those places, where we need it, would
save memory, keep the code cleaner, minimize sources for bugs.
Maybe something like FXbool GUIdirty may be used to indicate, that
several widgets should reread the settings and mark themself dirty.

BTW, have you already implemented something like the new file menu
command or open or any of these operations?
I have actually build up the infrastructure for the new files to test
the project browser.... but if you've done anything on this, we should
discuss this beforge merging.

Probably we won't need iterating. At the moment, I'm testing a way to 
read all settings from a
file placed in ~/.InDE/, replacing the options not found in that file by 
default values.
That seems not to be too difficult. Reading settings partly doesn't make 
sense since FXSettings,
FXStringDict and FXDict don't need much memory space. The basic way is this:

MainWindow constructor:

    settings = new FXSettings;
    FXString file = FXFile::getHomeDirectory + "/.InDE/settings.cfg";
    if (!FXFile::exists(file))
    {
        // user is running InDE the first time
        FXFile::create(file);
        defaultSettings();
        writeSettings();
    }
    settings->parseFile(file);
    completeSettings();

MainWindow quit method:

    settings->unparseFile(file);

Of course, this is only part of the actual code. I'm still not satisfied 
with it. Everything is a little stagnating
at the moment.

>BTW, have you already implemented something like the new file menu

No, I haven't. New file will actually only open a new empty tab in the 
editor, marking it as modified.

Hi Jochen.

We won't probably need FXbool GUIdirty since there are only two points 
in the code where settings
are changed:

    1. InDE settings dialog
    2. Project settings dialog

This means, directly after executing those dialogs settings are stored 
and written to the specific
settings file. (We do that in the quit/close project methods once again, 
just to be sure they are written).

At the moment, we have one variable for each option of the settings. We 
won't need the onUpd... and onCmd..
methods if we rewrite the settings dialogs so that they are given the 
values they need before execution (this would
reduce the types of dialogs to one (don't know whether this was 
explained clearly enough).

Instead of calling e.g. settings.editor.font we would use 
settings->find("EDITOR")->find("font"). All we have to make
sure is to add a default value for each variable not being found while 
parsing the settings file (if we call
settings->find("EDITOR")->find("font") without an existing section 
"EDITOR" we would run into a segfault).

As you can see, our first attempt of MainWindow might be totally 
revised. The reason why it's hard to merge
my latest stuff into SVN - I am trying to avoid that you have to arrange 
with a new codebase every few days.
But the codebase yet isn't good enough to develop upon.

My suggestion therefor is that you use the current base for testing and 
working on the project management as
well as creating class with both, header and source file (including a 
license header depending on the project settings)
and so on. That seem to be the things you are highly interested in. 
Luckily, we're writing on an OO program so
merging those parts with a new code base won't cost much of time.

During this, my part would be to heavily think about (and finally, 
write) a new well organized, as compact as
possible structure for InDE. I will also have a look into other, similar 
programs and how they are structured.

What do you think?

Kind regards,
Jannis

I'd prefer to see a basic Editor to better test some new functionality,
before everything (unimportant by now) will be restructured. Working on
too much points at one time never leads to satisfaction *g*

Ok. I am doing something very different: giving the new files a certain
structure.
So we just have to merge our code - two different functionalities for
one function - shouldn't be difficult.

If i've finished it.

BTW, i haven't coded any functionality you can do with the project
browser, except looking at it and surfing through the files. I need to
know the Editor API to give the project browser some functionality.

Maybe you can commit a basic structure if the API is sort of mature.

Fortunately the dependencies aren't very important for me, because most
work is done in seperate classes.
But testing the functionality means a) writing testapps, which i do for
certain classes, or b) using InDE for tests, wich is needed for other
things.
Why should i include all code to InDE to test the functionality, if all
this code, which has costed hours of work, is just thrown away and has
to be done completely from ground up again?

Don't loose the sight of it. That's what i think.
Implementing the settings as you proposed in the other mail and
finishing the editor would be a greater job by now. I guess with ongoing
development we will get a need for certain refactorings anyway. So do
it, if you need it, may be more straightforward and more satisfying,
because you see results and not only work to be done and to be thought
about it.

Actually we have no support for different views. What about them? If you
start to think about it, you will most probably be happy, if you arrange
to have a initial release at x-mas. OO supports us in refactoring, for
that we are not developing with something like C, where it is a pain in
the ass to refactor.

Don't get me wrong. Design and a good structure are very important. But
overdesigning can be a shot to the back. There always exists a better
solution, but trying to get the best solution before going on will never
let you go on. Trying to do the best you can at that point may fit best,
making things better at a later time with more knowlege about what is
needed and what blocks will lead to better solutions. At least this is
my point of view.

As far as i am used to develop with Java, i found it normal to rewrite
some classes or to move some code to new classes, which are than
insantiated from this class and so on. This is fun as far as you do it
as soon as it is needed, not earlier. And most of the time you get a
speed boost or some satisfaction because you latly growen code is now
more clear ;)

Right. Okay.

I found a better solution. I'm writing a Settings class which can be 
passed a file (which
is created if it doesn't exist already). It also has methods for 
settings default values and for
getting the value by a key (with or without passing the section it can 
be found in).

I think that's the best solution of all. For example if one wants to get 
the editor font, he could
simply use

    settings->getValue("EDITOR", "font");

wherase

    settings->getValue("font")

actually is going to work but might cause collisions with other "font" 
options
in another section.

This class avoids segfaults by using default values for options not 
being defined.
I will try to commit it to SVN tomorrow. After that we will have to 
change the project
settings dialog as well as the InDE settings dialog a little but that 
will only take a few
minutes.

Lots of the onCmd.. and onUpd... methods of MainWindow will be obsolete 
then, so I
will remove them.

Next thing I am changing is the menu bar creation in MainWindow. It will 
be moved
to a function called "buildMenu" or s.th. like that. It already looks 
very well structured
in my local repository.
Another change will be the message map. Currently our way to add a menu 
command handler
would be to add a

    FXMAPFUNC(SEL_COMMAND, MainWindow::ID_OURCOMMAND, 
MainWindow::onCmdOurCommand)

to the message map. The new solution I'd like to describe by an example, 
the file menu.

At first, this menu has a method
    long MainWindow::onFileCmd(FXObject*, ...)

The commands sent by the menu commands in this menu are collected using
    FXMAPFUNCS(SEL_COMMAND, MainWindow::ID_NEW_FILE, MainWidow::ID_QUIT, 
MainWindow::onFileCmd)

onFileCmd would look like this:

long MainWindow::onFileCmd(FXObject*, FXSelector sel, void*)
{
    switch (FXSELID(sel))
    {
       ID_NEW_FILE:
          editor->doSomething();
          break;
       ID_NEW_CLASS:
          showNewClassDialogOrSomething();
          break;
       ID_QUIT:
          quit();
          break;
    };
    return 1;
}

This means, we reduce the handler functions in order to add public functions
which could be called by other widgets directly (not by sending a 
message to MainWindow).

That's an easy to understand well looking structure in my opinion.

However, don't take all those news too serious as they will probably 
change a bit until
tomorrow. But I like it.

Regards,
Jannis

Sounds good!
That's something i thought about at the beginning of InDE, but i hadn't
known if or how it works, because i wasn't used to FOX.
I really like that idea!

Also sounds good! A bit more structured than the actual approach.
Espacially because the MainWindow class will grow with every new feature
that is application wide.

Let me start a discussion about the "new File" menu command.

Actually i added / changed the file menu to the following structure:

File
+ new >
  + new File
  + new Source
  + new Header
  + new Class
+ quit

That is actually for testing several file creation functions, but i am
not happy with that.

My idea about this is - compared to existing IDE's - a very new
approach:

File
+ new File
...

Project
+ new File(s)
  + Source
  + Header
  + Class
...

That means, if you use File -> new File, you get a new, untitled file,
which you have to store with "save as", and maybe add it to the project
by hand.
Project -> new File -> Source (..) will also produce a new file, but you
name it before it is created and add it to the project. Also it will be
creating the license header, ask for creating other related files, add
the file to SConstruct,....

As far as you have a project opened and a project menu, i always found
it very unstructured to add a file to the project with the file menu.

What do you think about this?
As far as you actually work at the menu structure, this may be the time
to do it this way.

PS: does FOX have something like FXObjectList for objects, not for
pointers to objects? I haven't found anything yet and therefore used a
std::vector<FXString>. It is ok, works fine, uses a clear and well known
API, but doing it the FOX way if FOX supports this, would be nicer ;)

Personally, I like creating files/classes by File -> New -> ...
Especially if you want to create a class, source or header file without
using the project manager these options would be better placed in the
file menu.

We could add a question "Add file to project?" for files that are
opened in the editor but have no filename/are not saved yet.

And if a project is opened the created files could be added automatically
(either on save or after creation).

Perhaps FXArray might  be interesting. It works like std::vector. You 
have to include FXArray.h in
order to use it.

Is FXArray a dynamic Array? This is unfortunately a class without
documentation.

Hi Jochen.

Yes, it is. You can use append() (and probably prepend() or insert()) 
for adding items to
the array. no() returns the size of the array.

Message-ID: <422CB7D8.1090705@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

I apologize the delay of my commit but there are some things I'm still 
working on.

The settings API is already done. We won't need to load the settings 
file from
~/.foxrc/FoxDefault/InDE but instead have a file which is called 
~/.InDE/settings.cfg
The functionality provided by the API can also be used for the project 
settings.

The tabbed editor already has minimalistic functionality like opening, 
closing
and saving one or all opened files and adjusting the font. That's ok for 
now and
I will further work on that after my commit.

Currently, I rewrite my SettingsDialog after moving the functionality to 
load
and store the values it modifies into the class itself (instead of 
MainWindow).
There are some generic thoughts about what should be in MainWindow and what
in the dialogs/widgets but I will report on that later.

Next thing: I had a look into some documentation tools. I tested doxygen 
for example,
but it didn't satisfy me. So I went for NaturalDocs 
(www.naturaldocs.org) which
offers very clean documentation syntax and neat looking layout. We can 
discuss this
on the list but my next commit will already include NaturalDocs 
documentated headers
for all classes.

And another topic I'd shortly report about: I know you're working on the 
project browser
so I tweaked the filesystem browser a little bit. There are context 
menus for directories
and files now, both for opening one or more files and importing files 
and directories.
They already use the minimalistic TabEditor API which you will get to 
know tomorrow, I
hope.

Best Regards,
Jannis

Hi Jochen.

Just a few seconds ago I compiled InDE on Windows and successfully 
opened and saved files with the TabEditor, changed font settings and so on.
Of course there are some parts where the current codebase would lead 
into errors, but it works!

Adding two or three lines of code to the SConstruct file does the job. 
That's great.

As far as i have another exam in a few hours i had no time to work on
InDE this weekend. 
I have some important dates this evening and tomorrow, so i will go on
to InDE thursday. Then there is a bit more time for the next two, maybe
three weeks, so things will grow ;)

why *.cfg? Is this meant for Windows compatibility?

I will have a look at it and arrange the project settings code.

The project browser is nearly finished. Things that are left to do are
the savings of the file lists and in InDE itself (not in the project
browser) the additions of files to the browser. 
As far as i see it is more sensefull to wait for your code to be checked
in to finish the browser. So i do not need to rewrite this code.

But it will only be a question of few hours to implement and test.

And some artworks are missing.... ;) 

BTW, while implementing the project browser i thought about possible
project structures.
One may wish to have a src/ dir and then split some modules to several
subdirs. E.g. 
src/main.cpp
src/some_other_stuff.cpp
src/module1/module1_implementation.cpp
src/module2/module2_implementation.cpp
...

I haven't included support for this yet. But i will have a look at this
later (for InDE > 0.1).

My primaryly plans are to get the basic project browser to work, include
it to InDE functionality. After that the inclusion of the GPL and LGPL
headers for new files will be added.
As soon as the project settings work with the new structure for
mainwindow,... i will start implementing the SConstruct file creation,
which will be the hardest job of this list.

As soon as this work is done, i am fine to have an initial release.
Hopefully we can get our timelines together so far.
Maybe we can run for the weekend of March 18th-20th?

regards,
	Jochen

Yes. I had a look at tons of icon archives (both, KDE-/Gnome-like and 
Windows). I came to the conclusion
that best would be to use typical Windows 2000 or XP icons. Wait a few 
days and I will upload an archive
which you can look at.

Yes, that's going to be hard - especially if we consider that later the 
user might have to add different
libraries for each platform he wants his software to be built on. For 
that, our settings class
might need something like a
     typedef FXArray<FXString> StringArray
and functions like
    setStringArrayValue()
    getStringArrayValue()

But we will see.

I prefer *.conf or no extension. As far as this is a settings for Unix,
we do not need a extension. If the file is named .InDE/settings it is
clear what it does. But if extension, i prefer *.conf, because it's the
Unix way.

Are these icons free?
If not, we can not use them because of the GPL of InDE.

I guess we have to carry some information together to locate the
problems. 
I have some ideas, but haven't thought in depth to all upcomming
problems. This will most probably be a topic next week(end).

But on the other hand, we could arrange this to be solved in later
versions more intelligent. As far as we use the project settings, one
can specify all needed libraries there and depending on this the correct
SConstruct is build. As soon as you move the project to another
plattform, it is needed to revise the project settings to change the
libraries.
I guess, that will do it for the very first release. (I also guess that
noone will use InDE 0.1 for large projects and especially not for too
complicated cross plattform projects)

All in depth SConstruct buildings depend on the task i added about the
project settings to know the compiler and OS. 

For all this we need to know compiler switches, library names (or
differences in them), linker options and so on. This will also be very
interesting for debugging support.....

Just to mention:
for the release we should add GPL headers to all files, an AUTHOR,
LICENSE, README and INSTALL file. The GPL headers can use a link to the
AUTHOR's file, to avoid future problems, if a new developer joins the
project *g*

So far. I guess this one was the last for this morning. I have to leave
soon for the exam...

Subject: [InDE-devel] Instructions: Using NaturalDocs for generating API docs
Message-ID: <422DFCDD.8020607@sten-net.de>

Hi Jochen.

As already mentioned, I'd like to use NaturalDocs (naturaldocs.org) in 
order to generate the API documentation
for InDE.

I've commited my latest work to SVN and added a file called
   
    gendoc.sh

You can download NaturalDocs, and (for example) move it to
   
    /opt/NaturalDocs/

If you then create a symlink like this:

    ln -s /opt/NaturalDocs/NaturalDocs /usr/local/bin/NaturalDocs

You can simply run ./gendoc.sh in order to generate the documentation. 
Since this is absolutely optional, I
don't think we should integrate it into the SConstruct file for InDE.

Regards,
Jannis

Hi Jochen.

I finally got my stuff commited to SVN. I removed your dialogs since the 
current SVN trunk
wouldn't build anymore with them (and I didn't want to do your work by 
changing them). You
may of course integrate them again.

Some notes (besides the API docs you can look at in doc/index.html) on 
the most
important API changes:

Class: InDE (previously called "App")
    - removed syntax file loading functionality (is now handled by 
TabEditor)

Class: MainWindow
    - all onCmd... and onUpd... functions
    + a public member variable "settings" which is an object of the 
class Settings
    > onCmdEditSettings() to editSettings()
    + methods applySettings(), resetSettings()
    + method readSettings() - default values are defined here
    + methods to build menus and content: buildMenu(), buildContent()
    + variable "editor" (class TabEditor) and method getEditor()
    > settings file is now created in ~/.InDE/. It's called "settings" 
without
      any extension on linux. On Windows, it is created as 
~/InDE/settings.ini
    ...

Class: SettingsDialog
    + method run() to execute the dialog
    + methods loadValues() and storeValues() (that's no longer handled 
by MainWindow)
    + some options

Class: Settings
    + All methods are written in two ways: with and without section 
parameter. The ones
      without a section parameter use section "GENERAL"
    + methods: setDefault() for integer and string values.
    + methods: getStringValue(), getIntValue() and getFormatValue() (the 
latter probably
      won't work already)
    + methods setStringValue, setIntValue() and setFormatValue() (the 
latter probably
      won't work)
    + methods parse(), read() and write()
    + method defaults(FXbool) for either filling missing values or 
filling and replacing
      all values with defaults defined using setDefault

Class: TabItem
    + Enhancement of FXTabItem. Can send messages to a target.

Class: Edit
    + represents an opened document/file
    + methods getFilename(), setFilename(), isModified() and setModified()
    + method setTitleTab() for connecting to a TabItem object which 
displays the
      file's basename
    + method setSyntax() for settings the syntax for the document

Class: TabEditor
    + tons of methods for loading a syntax file, determining the syntax 
of documents,
      opening, closing and saving one, more or all documents, and so on ...

Class: FileBrowser
    + Enhanced FXDirList. Provides context menus for files and 
directories like opening,
      importing and deleting.

I hope this helps. If you have any questions - ask them!

Kind regards,
Jannis

One thing I forgot to mention: Syntax highlighting already works fine, 
but the colors cannot be configured yet.
Therefor I added my current ~/.InDE/settings file to the share/ 
directory in SVN. You can simply copy
the section "STYLE" into your settings file, then start InDE.

Hi Jannis.

What is still missing on the project Website is the Dialog
Specification.

Maybe we should add a new section named "development ressources". There
we could add the link to the API and some specifications.

Next a link to naturaldocs would be great.

regards,
	Jochen

We could add a switch for this. Maybe something like:
	
	scons -GEN_DOCS

to automatically build the docs.

What about a cvn tree for the api docs. As far as i remember, there is a
possibility on berlios to generate webcontents from svn trees. So we
just have to commit the api-doc, but do not have to update the website
-- this job would be done by berlios. 
BTW, they provide nice scripts for the svn tree's, e.g. for a svn
Mailinglist: the script generates a mail to notify the users that new
versions have been commited to svn,....

I will work on this tomorrow. Maybe tonight, if i get a bit fitter than
now....
I guess i will commit my stuff in several small steps to get you
actually involved. And i want to avoid a commit-marathon like you did

I bet i will change many of those settings -> i guess i use a very

That sounds nice. Where can I find those scripts?

Might be possible, yes. The API docs already are accessable from SVN on

    http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/inde/trunk/doc/index.html

If there is a script provided by BerliOS it would be great to copy them 
from SVN to
   
    /home/groups/inde/htdocs/doc/

whenever the SVN tree is updated.

I'm not sure whether a stand-alone tree for the docs is necessary since 
theay are directly
connected to the sourcecode - it's only logical to update them with 
every change in the code.

Regards,
Jannis

Maybe not everyone on this list wants to see every patch. Also this may
be a bit too much for this list some days ;)

I also thought about adding a list inde-users some time. May be of
interest as soon as a first version is out.

Four lists for such a small project? InDE-users is ok, but I think 
developers have to confront
themselves with new revisions so InDE-devel might be the right list to 
post commits, don't
you think?

By the way, I made the api/ directory on our website a local SVN working 
copy of /trunk/doc. So
whenever you commit changes in the API docs it would be great if you 
could run "svn update"
in that directory. I am still searching for the ability to add a cronjob 
for that on the shell.berlios.de
server.

Jannis

Maybe you're right. It will be no problem to change this later on,
anyway. So it will be ok to have the commit messages on devel right now.

why a svn update in this directory? If i am in trunk and do a svn
update, doesn't that just do the right thing?

You probably misunderstood.

Normally, when you're commiting your work the commit will include the 
API docs in doc/ as well.
But of course this won't update the API docs linked on the website. So I 
made the website
directory api/ a local working copy of trunk/doc/. This means one can 
easily sync the ones
on the website with those on SVN by typing "svn update" (after logging 
in on shell.berlios.de
and switching to the directory /home/groups/inde/htdocs/api/).

This has nothing to do with what you do with the local working copy on 
your home computer.

But I think it's still too complicated. I am going to check if redirecting

    http://inde.berlios.de/api/*
to
    http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/inde/trunk/doc/*

works with the help of mod_rewrite and whether this would make browsing 
the docs less
fast.

Regards,
Jannis

Hm, some errors occured in r26. I hope all sources are still ok. The 
changes announced with r27 were already
made in r26 - which seemed to broke but somehow still was commited.

+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+               59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+
+	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    InDE - A fast and pragmatic C/C++ IDE
+    Copyright (C) 2005  Jannis Pohlmann, Jochen Rassler
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
+Public License instead of this License.

+
+===============================================================================
+
+
+
+I. Introduction
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+You may ask yourself: What is InDE? 
+We often call it "a fast and pragmatic C/C++ IDE". This means InDE is a program
+which you can use to write software. There are tons of useful features which 
+make developing fun:
+
+	<list of features>
+	
+<note on platform independent software development with SCons>
+
+
+
+II. Requirements
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+You at least need:
+
+	- Python >= 2.3
+	- SCons >= 0.93
+	- FOX >= 1.5.0
+
+
+
+III. Getting InDE
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+There are many ways to get InDE packages for your machine. The most common way
+is to visit our website at http://inde.berlios.de/ and download the latest
+stable (or development) release.
+
+If you use Linux, your distribution might already offer pre-compiled InDE 
+packages.
+
+Another way is to get our daily development snapshot at:
+	
+	http://inde.berlios.de/download/inde-snapshot.tar.bz2
+
+Finally, you can checkout the current Subversion tree by using the SVN command
+line client:
+
+	svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/projects/inde/trunk
+
+
+
+IV. Installation
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+After downloading the latest release or our daily development snapshot 
+from our website you will have to unpack and change to the directory
+you unpacked the archive at first:
+
+	tar xvjf <archive name>.tar.bz2
+	cd <archive name>/
+
+If you checked out the source from our SVN tree, go to the directory inde/trunk
+if you are not already in it.
+
+After this, every method will build and install using the same instructions, 
+that are:
+	
+	scons				-	Compiling
+	scons -c			-	Cleaning up the build
+	scons install		-	Install InDE
+	scons -c install	-	Uninstall InDE
+	scons docs			-	Make docs (they can be found in doc/)
+	
+You can get more information about available commands and parameters using
+
+	scons --help
+	
+	
+
+V. Getting started
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+While you are reading this README we probably might have created some 
+documentation for InDE already. You can read them by opening
+
+	docs/index.html
+	
+with a web browser of your choice. They are mostly validated XHTML documents so
+you can view them even with a text browser like Lynx.
+
+
+
+VI. Help and Support
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+If you run into problems or like to see new features getting integrated into
+InDE, feel free to join the InDE-users mailinglist at:
+
+	<mailing-list url>
+
+If you think you have found a bug, see next section for instructions on how to 
+let us now about them.
+
+Please let us know if you are using InDE for developing a certain software. 
+This way we can support you by an entry in the "Projects" list on our website.
+
+
+VII. Bug reports
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+You can report bugs either by posting them at
+
+	<bug-tracker url>
+
+or joining the InDE-devel mailinglist at
+
+	<mailing-list url>
+
+
+
+VIII. Joining development
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+There are many ways to contribute to InDE:
+	
+	- Translating InDE into another language
+	- Taking part in discussions on the InDE-devel mailinglist 
+	- Taking over maintenance for InDE packages for your Linux/BSD distribution
+	
+	<list of other possibilities>
+
+
+
+IX. License
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+InDE is licensed under GNU GPL. Its complete contents can be found in the
+LICENSE file.
+
+
+Thanks for using InDE!

Jochen, your idea to create a stand-alone SVN tree for the API docs 
seems to be good.
Everytime we commit new API docs together with other sourcecode, the 
messages sent from
SVN to this mailinglist grow too big (~60 kb) and no one can see the 
changes in the code because
of the high amount of HTML data.

Regards,
Jannis

and it's actually not really easy to understand the html data..... *g*

BTW, my actual commit does not provide very much functionality. I had to
rewrite most of my code, you deleted several classes with your
restructuring,...
Now i am back to the latest of my working versions.

Functionality and usability will be added next days. I actually wanted
to keep my code up to date with that in the repository. I also will
change some implementation... it's just working, few things aren't very
fine, actually.

Jochen

Actually there is a reason.
Regarding to Settings r24, subclassing from Settings had been ok, but i
do not see, why i should overload ProjectSettings with color settings
and so on. Also the Format settings will be deleted.

If we had a common base for the settings, e.g. CommonSettings.h, which
would implement reading/writing the StringValues and IntValues, give
functionality for parsing and writing, this would be a very fine super
class.

But Settings, as you are writing it, will hold many special
functionality, which isn't interesting for the project settings, and i
will also implement some functions, which aren't important for Settings.

Giving Settings and ProjectSettings a common base class, would be clear
so show that they relate and do basically similar things. But from the
code view, there is no reason to give those classes more common
functionality than FXSettings. I really can't imagine the following
scenario for any job:

snip >>>>>
CommonSettings	*settings;

Settings	*indeSettings = new Settings(...);
ProjectSettings *projectSettings = new ProjectSettings(...);

if (condition)
	settings = indeSettings;
else
	settings = projectSettings;

settings->doJob();

Hi,

a little tangential to the topic here, but I've been observing 
development of InDE lately (after it was mentioned on FOX GUI mailing 
list) since SCons is of interest to me.

Has the use of an XML format been considered for configuration file 
settings?
You're using FXScintilla for the text editing component, or so I've read 
from archives, right?

Thanks,
Eugene Wee

Yeah, SCons is really a very cool tool. Very easy to use and easier to
understand and modify than the GNU autotools. And BTW, Tom Tromey, one
of the authors of the autotools and the autotool book actually recomends
SCons ;)

Jeroen has implemented a very easy to use and straightforward settings
system for fox. He uses it mainly for standard fox settings, but it is
easy to modify to be on another place with other names.
So that is, what we are using now. It looks similar to every other
config file, known on the windows platform, but also known from several
unix tools, like cups etc.

We thought about using FXScintilla, but actually don't use it. But
Jannis may tell you more here in detail.

You don't have to overload the color and format functions. Writing a 
class which mostly has
the same functions seems a bit duplicate to me.

Settings *is* a superclass. It's just that the generic InDE settings 
don't need any further extensions.
ProjectSettings of course need them (like e.g. the project name) but 
Settings is intended to be a
super class, an enhancement of FXSettings.

I can't see any special features. Mostly, the functions of Settings are 
?quivalents to the read.. and
write.. functions of FXSettings.

Hi Eugene.

 XML is really nice of course, but to be honest, reviewing and modifying 
an INI-file is much easier
than to do this with an XML file (INI has a much simpler syntax -> files 
are more concise).

>>You're using FXScintilla for the text editing component, or so I've read

Yes, I thought about it. But it's not yet ported to FOX 1.4 (as far as I 
know). Another reason for not
choosing it was its "strange" messaging system. I prefer to change 
properties by specific
functions (like setFont or setForeColor) instead of using the same 
method for each change
just with a specific parameter (like SCI_STYLESETFONT).

Due to this, I chose to use a simple FXText combined with 
Syntaxhighlighting as it is used
in Adie (the editor written by FOX author Jeroen). We will see whether 
this way is good or
not.

I didn't mean to overload the functions itself, but giving the class
functions it doesn't need (which are e.g. the color and format
functions)

Actually i have some code (not yet very much), that is outside of
ProjectSettings, but belongs to it. It would be much more structured to
move it inside ProjectSettings. For this i need some more special
functions for reading and writing those data structures.

What do you plan to add to Settings in future?
I will have a look, if Settings will fit. Actually i only need
read/write IntValues and StringValues, parse and write. All other
functions are completely uninteresting to me. So only very few code is
duplicated (most of it oneliners). If Settings won't grow evry much any
more, it will be ok. If it will grow, things will change.

Subclassing is still better than duplicating. Although you don't need 
some functions the functionality
of ProjectSettings exactly is the same.
Somehow, keeping the two classes separated would be like forking FOX in 
order to remove
FXDocument just because you think you don't need it.

I'm sure you could add them to a subclass of Settings as well.

Nothing new. Settings is not meant to reflect the InDE settings. Its 
supposed to be an
enhancement of FXSettings. And the function names are more usual than 
those of
FXSettings. That's all. It's kind of an abstract class for saving 
structured settings into
a file. Nothing more.

I'm sure it won't - the reasons you can read above.

Hi.

I just thought about if there are icons we already could use. Jochen, do 
you know how the Eclipse icons are licensed? I know you're much
more familiar with Java than me.

I reviewed the iconsets I promised to send you but they're mostly 
useless. Some folders and generic Windows-XP-style icons but nothing
to be specifcially used for an IDE. That's why I thought about a usage 
of the Eclipse icons if their license is compatible to GPL.

If not, we might have to wait for some public interest to come. Perhaps, 
this will also make some application-whatever designers aware
of our project. Who knows ...

Eclipse uses a free license, but it isn't free as the GPL. RMS see's its
license uncompatible to the GPL.
But i actually don't know the icons license of eclipse. I will have a
look at this and report.

Ok, it seems everything important for us is licensed under the CPL,
eventually some things under the EPL, wich is compatible to the CPL, but
without some restrictions.

Both licenses are free software licenses, but not GPL compatible in
sense of RMS. But i guess we can use Eclipse icons without problems,
because they are licensed under a free license.

Of course it'd be nice to have our own icons, but until then it seems ok
to use Eclipse's icons.

We should drop a note to that in a file in the SVN tree to report we are
using Eclipse's icons and that they are licensed under the CPL.

Thanks very much for the research. The problem with most free icons is 
the size. For menus we will need
icons with 16x16 and it's hard to find free icons for that. And if you 
resize larger ones it looks very
ugly in FOX. That's why I thought about the ones from Eclipse.

So then, I will look at their CVS repository to download the icons in 
order to test whether they
integrate well or not.

Of course, own icons would be great. But until there's no real public 
interest there probably won't
be designers interested in working for us.

Janis

We don't use Makefiles and the autotools. Actually there isn't any
support for autotools planned. But we use a newer buildsystem called
SCons (http://www.scons.org/ ) and build our project management on top
of it. That means, if you create a new project, InDE creates a SCons
build file.

For the user there is no big difference:
scons
scons install

builds and installs the sources. Something like configure is not needed,
because SCons does this job in a very straightforward manner. Maybe you
want to have a look at their website.
SCons has serveral advantages, e.g. it is plattform independent, is very
easy to understand and to enhance. You will like it!

Now to the dialog editor. We haven't discussed this yet. Jeroen (the FOX
author) actually works on the serialization of FXObjects, in particular
how to store and load the widgets. Sander (another FOX developer) plays
around with it to get an impression, how to implement a dialog/GUI
editor, which supports for changes in the GUI, while the development on
a project goes on. They also plan to load the GUI on runtime, but it
seems they plan to implement it very different than you want.

I just searched the FOX archive to provide you with some links about
this discussion and found you as a member there. So i don't need to give
you the links and explain this in more detail, i guess you are more
familiar with Jeroens approaches about this topic than me.

I for myself had thought about including a GUI builder to InDE, but not
until the basic IDE supports you for normal C++ development. So please
feel free to give us feedback about your project progress. I guess this
will be a good point to work together.

Maybe this was a kick to start discussion about GUI builder for InDE. If
so, please feel free to provide us with infos and join the discussion ;)

Hi Jochen.

Hard to say. I understand the first release as a kind of testrun. The 
TabEditor class
I've written very fast and withought spending much attention on how good 
the
implementation really is. And that's the point where I can't really cope 
with this
task system (remember I doubted it already in the beginning?): often 
it's really hard
to say when a certain task is done. Adding a certain feature is ok in 
this system
but defining the percentile status of a whole class is extremely 
complicated.

But I will set the status to something about 40% since we're already 
able to highlight
text and stuff.

Regards,
Jannis

Yes, that's right. I guess it's the question how to interpret the
tasksystem.

My interpretation is like this:
* adding a task to show, that something is planned and show the priority
of this task relative to other things
* if the task is in developing state, actualize the progress bar to show
it's in development
* if it works and has the basic functionality you planned, set it to
100% and maybe close the task
* if you want to add something important, which isn't in the first task,
open a new task
* if the code needs improvement, open a new task.

Example for the TabEditor class:
* open a task to show it has to be implemented
* as development goes on, set the percentage to higher values
* if it is ready to use, finish and close the task
* open a new task for ctags-support
* if you think, some things has to be changed, also open a task for this


That's how i saw the task system used by other projects and think this
is one possible way to go. At least this may be most usefull for users
to see what's going on and what they can expect for the next releases.
Surely, there will always be a task at high priority, that isn't
implemented, because you see the need to work on another part at that
certain time...

Maybe our other users at the mailinglist have wishes how the task system
is to be handled?

	Jochen

Hi Jannis.

I could swear I had seen a function in FXFile or elsewhere, that
returned you the platform dependend directory character (/ on Unix, \ on
Win32). But I can't find it anymore. Do you have any hint?

BTW, what about a "os.h" file, where all dependencies can be collected
in a large 
#ifdef WIN32
#else
#endif 
loop to avoid all those nice statements in normal class files. This
could make portability easier and clearer, in particular if any other
platform we eventually will move our code to has some diffences to
Linux.
This also could be the case if we use external tools at any time in
future (can't actually imagine an example, but there most probably will
be...)

	Jochen

As far as I can see there is no function like this. But whenever you 
want to access
something in the filesystem you can use the following functions to merge 
directory
and file names. Normally, this should be enough since there won't be a 
single
directory which wasn't either selected by using FXDirSelector etc. or 
directly
entered by the user (then, it is his problem if the directory doesn't 
exist).

/// Return absolute path from current directory and file name
FXString FXAPI absolute(const FXString& file);

/// Return absolute path from base directory and file name
FXString FXAPI absolute(const FXString& base,const FXString& file);

/// Return relative path of file to the current directory
FXString FXAPI relative(const FXString& file);

/// Return relative path of file to given base directory
FXString FXAPI relative(const FXString& base,const FXString& file);

Do we really need that? Okay, perhaps we will, but at the moment I see 
now reason
for creating a structure of this kind. There is no platform-specific 
code yet - as far
as I can see. If you really need to add a DIR_SEPARATOR constant/define 
doing that
in InDE.h probably would be best.

Jannis

Okay, I'll do my best to write down every single task I'm working on. 
It's probably
good for the interested people to see what actually is going on in our 
brains.

Hey, yeah - you'll definetly need something like megaphone in order to

May probably the best for now.
How to seperate between char and string? Does a define this job or is it
better to use two const expressions for that.
If you have FXString str= DIR_SEPARATOR + file, does a define really fit
well at this?

If you download the icons, it would be nice if you also got the icons
for files, directories, and so on for the project browser ;)

You're right. But did you test if those FXFile methods I sent to you 
work with two
directories instead of one directory and a filename?

Yes, but it could be replaced by something platform independent. See below
for what I am thinking of.

I think of having a better idea: We could write something like a 
filesystem abstraction
layer on the top of the functions provided by the FXFile namespace.

FileSystem would be a simple yet effective name for it, I think. This 
could also provide a method
dirSeperator(). What do you think? I would volunteer for doing this tonight.

Jannis

I do not see why this could be of any help. We have almost all functions
plattform independant, except the dirSeperator and our own Filenames and
Pathes.

I think this would be too much work for the very little benefit of it
and we have to administer the code: Jeroen might change the interface,
there might be bugs,...

Or Do you have any special task for a FileSystem class?

Don't be to hard to them.
Our two new members, Vlad and Eugene, are present on this list and do
not only read.

Until we have released any code you can't hardly expect to have a large
audience, so be proud of every user which joins the discussion!

Perhaps a namespace with a collection of functions instead of a class 
would be
enough. I didn't think of much, just a few functions like dirSeparator() or
mergePath(base, ...) (using a variable list of parameters to be merged 
using the
dirSeparator().

I think that would help, wouldn't it?

Okay, just to explain the added functions:

dirSeparator():
    should be clear

hiddenName(FXString&):
    On Linux a hidden file is identified by the leading "." in the 
filename. On Windows this is unimportant. This
    function returns either ".filename" or "filename", dependent on 
which platform you are on.

configFilename(FXstring&):
    On Windows, filename extension are useful for associating programs 
with a filetype. On Linux this is mostly
    obsolete due to mime-types (yes?). So this function returns 
"filename.ini" on Windows but "filename" on Linux.

That's all. Those functions at least removed #ifdef WIN32 out of the 
MainWindow constructor. Hehe.

Regards,
Jannis

Hi,

Well, for the most part I'm an observer here.
I would contribute more if I could (perhaps even join as a developer), 
but my knowledge of the FOX toolkit is minimal, and my understanding of 
how the project should progress is rather sketchy.

Thanks :)

Well, I think that what is important here is not an accurate/precise 
value, but just a rough gauge based on gut feeling, so that people have 
an idea what's happening.

After all, who cares if a task is said to be 60% complete when it is 
actually 59% complete?

Hm... I hadn't the knowledge of the FOX Toolkit in the beginning too.
More, I hadn't coded in C++ very much and that was long time ago. I
normally work with Java.
Learning by doing is always the best way, I guess.
So, feel invited ;)

So I am glad that the task system provides us only with multiples of 5%
*g*
You think the same way than me!

Wouldn't it be nicer to call this function hideName()?

Yeah, I know it's hard to get through our chaotic minds. Hehe. Well, 
what we're currently doing is to write code for a first test release. 
This will give proof of our ideas and concepts. Then, we will most 
probably have an idea of how to improve our codebase.  For example, the 
TabEditor's API was written down in very short time compared to its 
complexity and thus is not very mature at all.

Contributing to the code without knowing FOX is difficult, of course. 
But perhaps you have some conceptual ideas on certain parts of an IDE in 
general? For example: Which parts should the focus be on? In which 
points do other IDEs fail? Are there useful features you ever wanted to 
have in an IDE? Or: When does an IDE get "blown-up" status?

Yes, that's how I treat it now. I add a task for everything I'm 
appending to my TODO list. I set a task to 100% when it's basically done 
but let it open if it is still supposed to be enhanced. Once something 
is really done I'm going to close it. The percentage of course is a real 
vague value.

Regards,
Jannis

Actually the function doesn't execute any action to hide a file or 
things like that. As
it simply returns the hidden name of a file I consider this name a good 
choice.

Hi All.

Attached is a actual snapshot of Inde (for those who haven't seen

Maybe we should add one on the website?

Hi Jannis.

Did you receive mail notices for r36 and r37.
I am missing some mails on InDE-devel.

My actual commit with a little bug fix for compiling isn't shown to me.
I guess this was r37. But what is with the other one?

Yes, I received those mails. The problem was the newly generated API 
docs actually where
too big (about 420kb) since the limit for the mailinglist is about 60kb.

I therefore removed them from the SVN trunk so we will be able to see 
new revisions again
here.

Hi,

That's a good idea, currently the 'screenshots' page is rather blank.

Yes, you did. Hehe. That's no problem. As long as Jeroen hasn't fixed 
the library
naming problem I'm going to use FOX 1.4 anyway.

Just thought about this. (Yes, I know I should rather learn for the
exams than hacking or thinking about InDE..... )

What are your skills? 
Do you know about the internals of CVS or SVN? 
What other langueages than C++ do you "speak"?

Tasks, which could be of interest for you, where you do not have to know
all the FOX internals could be:
* add SVN or CVS support
* we work hard, to get InDE working for C++, you could maybe expand InDE
to support other languages.

Syntax highlighting is actually supported for:
language "C++"
language "C"
language "Shell"
language "Pascal"
language "Configure"
language "Python"
language "Ruby"
language "Xml/Html"
language "IDL"
language "C#"
language "Markup"
    filesmatch "*.html,*.xhtml,*.xml,*.sgml,*.php"
language "Make"

I'd like to see support for Java and maybe we need something special for
SCons (wich is basically Python). But that isn't very high priority.

The complete project management is aimed for C++ projects. That also may
fit for C projects.
I only "speak" the following languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal. So,
supporting Java and C projects should be easy for me, but I don't know
anything about Python, Ruby, C#,.... and their structures.

Also it may be of interest to execute programs from Inde and fetch their
output (high priority!). This is needed very soon and could be added as
soon as the SCons file construction is implemented (i will start this
tommorow i hope). So we could add a menu command "build project" wich
basically executes "scons", fetches the output and prints it to a Fox
Window.

May you have other skills, which will be of need and i haven't thought
about.
Just scream, what may be of interest to you ;)

Hope this motivates *g*

Jochen

At least Ruby *could* be my part. I'm "talking" Ruby nearly every day.

Basically, that should be no problem at all. I already did this with FOX 
(wrote a PO-file
generator in Ruby). I'm thinking of some great output parser which adds 
markers to
lines in a document where compile errors were found and stuff like that.

Hi Jochen,

I dont know the internals of both CVS and SVN, I'm a sort of a 
pedestrian user of them.
However, I do 'speak' PHP, so I might be able to help in that area.

Yeah, the latter seems most likely now.

What do you mean by "something special for SCons"?

Much of PHP's basic syntax is a copycat of C, like C++ and Java.
Still, I could look into this, though it will not be a priority I'm 
afraid as I'm currently learning to use SQLite.
Speaking of SQLite, maybe SQL syntax highlighting is due, though there 
is the problem of dialects.

Well, I am apt to volunteer as a doc writer, but usually a good wiki 
eliminates this need.

Subject: [InDE-devel] Thoughts and ideas
Message-ID: <423A4145.6030300@sten-net.de>

Hi all.

I observed progress on the project management a little and tested the 
NewClassDialog
recently. Although there are good approaches I'd like to point out some 
weak points regarding
some of our concepts.

The project management lacks of strategy although that's not your fault, 
Jochen. I established
preprocessor defines for the project type and that's been a really bad 
idea. We should
better implement things like that using enum typedefs.

Currently, nearly all actions concerning a project are handled by 
ProjectBrowser. Same with
actions concerning the filesystem. That's ok for now but in the near 
future there are
far more objects which will need to access those actions/methods. The 
class browser or the
CtagHandle for example. This means, instead of using ProjectBrowser for 
all things concerning
the projects we should use some meta-class like objects. I'd call them 
Project and ProjectManager
(a class managing a FXObjectListOf<Project*>, handling stuff like 
getProjectByPath(),
getCurrentProject() and so on).
This would have many advantages. For example, project and class browsers 
could set the current
project independently whenever they get focus or you select a certain 
item in them.
We also could add functions like
     enum ProjectType Project::getProjectType()
to those classes.

Instead of a static list of natively supported licenses we could simply 
provide a dialog
to change the content of the LICENSE file (lets say in the main project 
dir). Depending on files
anywhere in the filesystem always equals chaos. Same applies to the 
syntax file. We simply could
support a syntax file located in the user's InDE directory (copied there 
on first startup), not
allowing the user to select a file located anywhere. A little dialog to 
edit it using an instance
of the Edit class (or a class similar to TabEditor just without tabs) 
would be enough, then.

For the syntax highlighting we will also need a more elegant color 
editing solution than Adie uses.
In Adie, some rule colors of different styles overlap due to similar names.

What we'll probably need some day is a kind of terminal widget. I 
already tried to implement one
using FOX during the last days but it seems to be too complex for the 
moment.

Remember we wanted to release an early version of InDE this weekend? I 
guess we won't. There's
to much reformation needed to get things working.

Yet, I'm proud our project actually evolves and there's still notable 
activity and interest on
the part of the (little team of) developers.

So what will be the next steps?
Jochen, I know you'd like to schedule a release as early as possible but 
if we don't want to
stubmle into chaos we will have to discuss and share exchange views once 
again before (likely)
reorganizing part of the code.

Kind regards,
Jannis

Subject: [InDE-devel] Additional thoughts
Message-ID: <423A5576.1010404@sten-net.de>

Hi again.

Some thoughts on ...

Modularization:

I just browsed the Mozilla source code today and learned XUL + XPCOM for 
about ten hours.
While doing so I noticed that it is of great importance to keep your 
code as modular as
possible. Thus, I'm planning to separate the styling part out of 
TabEditor into a new class
with a name like StyleEngine. That way we could - just for example - 
provide syntaxhighlighted
editor widgets anywhere without having to use the TabEditor. Might be 
useful for editing
the syntax file some day or if you want to detach the current document 
from the TabEditor to
a single-document window. That's basically just ideas.


Coding style:

Perhaps we should define some code styling conventions. This would make 
the code more
readable for everyone. Personally, I like the code style they're using 
at Mozilla (w/o emacs line):
    http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/mozilla-style-guide.html#Visual
I'd prefer to use it instead of the mixed code we're using at the moment.


That's it for now. What do you think?

Thanks for the flowers.

It lacks strategy and it's not my fault ???
Thanks in advance!

But maybe you should wait untill things progress. If you've noticed, I
don't code weeks and weeks, before i commit the stuff to svn. So you
only notice the structure that is in the repository, but not what is in
mind. Keep on watching before kicking it.

What an ugly design decission.
There is absolutely no need for preprocessor defines! Just let me
improve the code and you will see, what way to go.

BTW, have you ever coded larger apps in Java? There are no preprocessor
defines, because you do not need them, if you use a good design.
Or do you just mean the PROJECT_TYPE_CPP,... which are from you and will
be removed soon?

That's what is planned.

Well, the project browser implements only those methods, which
correspond to the project browser. Except the opening of a file, but
this seems to be another discussion. For those things we can start a new
thread to discuss.

Also, if it is needed to give things a better structure or way to
access, while implementing new features, THIS is the time to build this
structure, not any hour earlier!

I remember you wouldn't even support several projects at once. What
should those classes do?

Why? A project may be a Java project, but uses several C++ classes or C
code to access system calls..... 
Having such a static project setting would kick out the need for SCons.

You don't know how it will be implemented. So please don't argue about
that before you know how things will be done.
The only dependency to the file system occurs, if the user chooses a non
supported (non-standard) license.
Also wait and see before accusing it!

That's what i always said. But if you remember, we decided not to change
this before other basic things are implemented and/or improved.
For example, the editor is very unstable. Why not first improve the
editor code base to eliminate all those ugly seg faults? InDE is
absolutly useless as long the editor doesn't work properly!

You told me, you had written some code, that executes external commands
and fetches the output. Maybe you'll give me that code, i will see what
can be done to this.

And one day means, that it is one day needed. No need to get a headache
by now!

Hey, slowly!
If you mean a reformation like the last, simply forget it! 
You removed several classes, deleted code,.....
I had two days work to get all functionality back to InDE and back to
work. If you start a new reformation such this one, I'd need more time.
And i hate to implement everything twice. 
Maybe you should read "Software entwickeln mit eXtreme Programming" von
Lippert, Roock, Wolf. I really recomend that book. And for you
especially the parts of Refactoring.

We can discuss about code improvements and than do it step by step. But
i will not support this, if the discussion or improvement is done with
the sledge hammer, like this mail or the last restructuring!

And, I still believe, it's best to get things actually working,
releasing a snapshot and working on new features and improvements of old
features.

It looks like every time you think about a new feature which could be
added any time, you find the InDE code not fitting anymore and rewriting
the complete code every time.
This isn't only ineffective, but also senseless and short viewed.

If you don't want to end in chaos, follow a clear line and don't loose
in senseless reorganizations every two weeks.
Sure, little reorganizations are needed all times, but little. I don't
support a rewrite every two weeks.

And, let me do the restructuring of my code! I don't want to rewrite it
every time!

I still keep our schedule in mind!

InDE evolves, that's clear. It's only that I noticed parts of our code 
aren't very well
thought-out and thus, there are many sources of error. I wanted to introduce
new ideas, not an immediate reorganization of the code.

It currently also is responsible for opening a project and that will 
lead into conflicts
with - for example - the class browser. A kind of ProjectManager class 
with a list of
projects located in MainWindow simply would be better.

Several projects would be no problem (that's what a ProjectManager would 
be responsible
for - handling projects). The Project class could be seen as a layer 
over ProjectSettings,
providing useful things like a project directory/files iterator class 
and things like that. I read
a lot about design patterns recently. That could be useful.

The projectType must not be used as a static setting - but it could (yet 
must not) be
used for the File => New ... => Class. I'm thinking of a projectType 
dependent
Factory for the class creation, support several languages (each with 
their own
builder). Practical design patterns once again.

No need to get angry. I'm not going to change anything of the code until 
I've
seen something more complete. But a single LICENSE file where you can
paste text into using a dialog doesn't require much work and a simple check
if the file exists when creating a class file should be no problem either.

If you think of being able to provide something easier and user friendly 
- good!

Yes, tri-state return values for saveDocument() are coming. That's the 
most disturbing
issue at the moment (from my point of view). The rest works as far as I

That wasn't C++. It was written in Ruby. A terminal still is something 
completely
different as it includes getting a TTY device as well as writing and 
reading from it.

Maybe I should. But you have to think about at least two things: An IDE 
is not a tiny
program, instead it's complex. And we should have had more discussions about
it before writing code. It's true that you can't think of everything and 
write
a program from the scratch without problems - but one should at least try to
develop concepts before starting. That's what I learn with every day I 
deal with
InDE.

Maybe we're not sophisticated programmes yet, so we have to realize that
development sometimes leads to a dead end where you have to reconsider
things. If we're honest, there is not much code yet. Most parts are attempts
which will be rewritten - maybe from the scratch - either way.

InDE is not an application written down in a month or two. I'm not afraid
of rewriting core stuff that will be important for nearly everything in the
near future if it makes the software more sophisticated.

>

It's not intended to be a "sledge hammer". It's just brainstorming and 
writing
down experiences. Sure we could do everything step by step but that exactly
is the problem. If you add something like the ProjectManager (and 
Project) as
I suggested, more things have to be reviewed. If we had a comfortable 
project
directory/files iterator the listing in the ProjectBrowser would be much 
easier.

The only problem is, those ideas require a complete review of InDE. I 
will do
that anyway (and make it a folder InDE-rev on my harddisk) but I won't 
apply
the code to the official InDE until you agree on it.

Features aren't a problem, it's the way they're implemented currently. 
That's not
your fault, as project leader I had to kick development into the right 
direction but
unfortunately I didn't. I'm not that experienced yet.

That's one of my vices. I know that I'm always running the risk of 
losing partners
this way but in this case we're simply naive when thinking the codebase 
is mature
or even ready for features do be written on the top of it.

We have to go step by step but that's not what we did in the beginning. 
Hm, it's
hard to properly describe my thoughts.

I understand that completely. But there's no need to shed tears about 
written
code when you are are going to write something new which adds to it.

I support this always. You know that.

Let me do this, as soon as work progresses in that area.
We have too much pieces in our todo list, that everyone can work on
every place.

No it is not responsible for opening projects. It is just responsible
for filling the project browser with the contents (files) of the
project.
Maybe i've chosen not the best name for that function, but it loads the
contents from the view of the project browser, but not the complete
project.

This is ok. Having a project manager, which is possessed by main window
and delegates to it's classes, not like now, were the accessing code has
to be implemented in MainWindow. But this leads to a small refactoring,
which can be done while reviewing the code.

I aim to implement a different approach. This depends on my previous

This may be useful for the user defined license, but not for others.

But this is not needed now.
I bet we have more important things to do now, than implementing a
terminal.

Ok, to express it in other words:
let us finish the work that is in progress and not yet ready (e.g.
stability of the editor, SCons constructing, some more methods for
adding, deleting,... files to the project). If all open points work
well, let us release this stuff and discuss about the problems we have
with this design, what may lead to problems, what can be done for better
modularization, which code should be moved to another abstraction
layer,....
If we do so, we get several benefits:
* users provide us with bugreports, so we get feedback on problems, we
might not have seen yet.
* we know, how we planned some things to implement
* we know, what will come next and what problems may occure for this (we
can not plan for features comming in years....)
* ...

I do not see a dead end alley at the moment.

Including the above, InDE will be complex, so trying to design it once
will lead to dead ends. So, we have to do it step by step, and not
always try to rewrite it at once, no matter how much code exists. You
will continue this approach your life long and don't get any progress,
but you need to.

see above.
Do it step by step, and as i mentioned in several mails before, do it
when it's needed, and only those parts which need to be rewritten and
not the whole stuff at once. Also everything is new, it hasn't to be
better, only because it'sd new!

You introduced the sledge hammer!
Surely, you have to do it step by step, except you want to implement the
same stuff for years without any progress.

If that's what you intend....

A complete review doesn't mean a complete rewrite.
And for me, i won't agree a complete rewrite now. At least the way you
plan it!

No, you are wrong. If that were true, you wouldn't actually do what

I never said, the codebase were mature.
But rewriting it every two weeks doesn't do any better.

That's what you hadn't done!
For me, at least my plannings for the project management is step by
step, at least so far you let me do it.
If i always have to bring my code back on, i can't progress from one
step to the next. That is the actual problem i have with improving my
own code. You don't give me the time for that!

I don't mind to throw code away if it's ugly or morbid.
But if that code is the base of thoughts and will be improved, you don't
have to throw it away, before any improvement could have been done to
it. That's why i'm crying!

Okay. At first, thanks for bringing me back down to earth. I will 
optimize the current
TabEditor implementation concerning stability and you will have time to 
implement
what you wanted to. No need to hurry.

We will then throw out a first release some day and - as you suggested - 
discuss
about experiences, disadvantages and positive aspects - simply everything.

I will implement those parts I'd like to change - but won't - for 
myself. They won't
be introduced into the current codebase but perhaps we can use them for
the release thereafter. It really is some neat stuff, you'll see. Hehe.

There are two ways: Reformating the base until they're good enough to 
build everything
else upon - or writing the base once and optimizing it step by step 
while implementing
everything else upon it. The latter seems odd to me. But I'll wait with 
my criticism until
the first test release is out.

I think it's better to have a base you can rely on than to have a base 
you have
to change whenever you realize it isn't yet ready for a new feature. To 
a certain
degree, both require changes from time to time - that's for sure - but 
my simple
criticism is that the current base is not yet ready for even the 
low-level features.

We can't handle projects by simply adding a ProjectSettings object to 
GUI widgets.
We need something better. OK, you seem to be up to something - then I'll 
give
you enough time to develop your stuff.

I will have a look at it.
After some crashes while just beginning to hack i avoided to use InDE
and used Adie once again. So i have to try to reproduce.

The point is, can you say for sure, that after a rewrite everything is
ready to build all the future things upon it without doing major
changes?
That's why i want to do it step by step. Just to refactor always little
parts as they need to and not only sometimes the whole thing at once.

I intent to always think about the code base and do little changes, if
the code base doesn't fit instead of hacking without thinking and then
standing in front of a big mountain and start wondering where to start.

I am actually up on the internals.
I have seen that the access to the projects and project settings is not
intentional, but every idea i had would be only cosmetic.
I believe we have to discuss this in more detail, but for this it seems
to be best to have all the basics. So we can estimate where the class
will evolve to.

Sure. The problem is that basic stuff almost everytime involves tons of 
changes
to the things relying on it. I can't imagine the work that would be 
necessary to
reorganize codebase with, lets say 100k lines of code. The advantage of
refacturing now would be that there aren't that much components written yet.
But that's just how I see things.

Sounds good actually. I have ideas about that. As already mentioned I 
could imagine
a kind of meta information object for each project which wraps the 
information it
fetches from its ProjectSettings member into something useable for other 
components.
Like e.g. a project directory/file iterator class which could be used in 
the project browser
- or a default <LanguageOfChoice>ClassBuilder object which is factorized 
dependent on the
projectType. those ClassBuilder (e.g. CppClassBuilder) could be used to 
store and validate
information entered into the NewClassDialog. That's one of those things 
for the future which I'm
currently working on. Intelligent components which aren't easy to 
integrate into the current
codebase without much changes.

Jannis

Ok, try to reproduce it like this:
open two or more existing Files and start modifying one of them, e.g. by
clicking to the end of one line and hit enter.

TabEditor::restyleDocument(2, 5997, 0, 1)
Speicherzugriffsfehler

That's my output

Do you want to write a code generator?
If not, it sounds a bit oversized just to create the basic class /
project infrastructure.

Yes, I had that in mind. To be honest, I've already written it. Hehe.

An iterator class for files in the project would be great. I don't think 
that's oversized.
This way the project meta class would have to wrap the files listed in 
project.inde into
a simple struct/class structure. Afterwards it would be easy to write an 
iterator for that.

That's just an idea but could be useful for the project browser for example.

Besides I'm somewhat thinking of separating InDE into the program itself 
and
a "InDE Foundation Library". This means we would add all these classes 
we need
into a library and then use them in InDE itself. The program's code 
itself was much
shorter, then - and other developers could use the library to build 
editors etc.

That would too much for the first release, but thereafter ... - what do 
you think?

The problem most probably is in one of the methods of TabEditor that 
determine
which document has changed (inserted, replaced, deleted) and then try to 
restyle
it. Restyling seems to be ok, but sometimes a wrong document is 
determined and
then the app crashes. I'm working on it.

Well, they're not that different from the guidelines of the Mozilla 
foundation. But I'd like
to mark variables with a certain prefix so that everyone is able to see 
where they come
from (examples: mProjects - member variable, gStyles - global variable9 
and what their
purpose is. That's not covered by the Java conventions, I think. Often 
authors of such
directives advise you not to use things like prefixes but it's a good 
way to make things
much clearer in my opinion.

I will write a guideline and ask you to review and share your opinion 
about it.

Regards,
Jannis

Hi.

I've worked on it again and although it's on my TODO list for the things 
to come after
the initial test release, I think we can already use it - if you agree.

It is relatively simple:

There is a struct "MethodParam" with two members: name and type of the 
parameter
(both FXString). Then, there is a class "ClassMethod" to which you can 
apply parameters,
modifiers (const, virtual and so on), access level (public, private, 
...) and return type.
That's all (mostly) language independent. It at least work for Java, 
Ruby, Python,
C++ and Delphi/Pascal.

Next there is a abstract class "ClassBuilder". It provides basic methods 
for adding
methods to the class, to set the class name. But most important are the 
virtual methods
it has, like validating, rendering and writing methods. These have to be 
overloaded by
the language-specific classes.

Finally, we've got a subclass of "ClassBuilder" for each language (e.g. 
CppClassBuilder or
RubyClassBuilder). We need to subclass "ClassBuilder" in order to have 
the same
API for every language ClassBuilder so that we later can use something 
like this:

ClassBuilder* builder;
switch (dialog.Language()) {
    case Java:
       builder = new JavaClassBuilder(dialog.ClassName());
       break;
    case Ruby:
       builder = new RubyClassBuilder(dialog.ClassName());
       break;
    default:
       builder = new CppClassBuilder(dialog.ClassName());
}
if (builder->IsValid()) {
    builder->Finalize();

    // C++ differs from any other language due to its separation of
    // declaration and implementation so we have to create two
    // files instead of one:

    if (builder->Language() == Cpp) {
       builder->write(builder->Name() + ".h", builder->Name() + ".cpp");
    } else {
       builder->write(builder->Name() + builder->Language()->Extension());
    }
}

This would be (nearly) everything we needed to write in order to create 
valid sourcecode for
any OO language.
Of course, there is no function "IsValid". Instead, there are few more 
functions for the validation
so that we are able to react on invalid class names, an invalid method 
and so on individually.

Those classes depend on nothing of the current sourcecode and thus would 
integrate fine
into it. This would make the "Create Class" command possible in the test 
release already.

What do you think, Jochen?

I forgot to mention that I'm writing classes for the languages itself at 
the moment.

Those derive from an abstract class "Language" and have mostly static 
methods for
validation the names of types, parameters, functions, classes and 
modifiers as well
as some methods for retrieving the default file extension for that 
language and so on
and so on ...

This means: Every programming language we want to support require two 
classes
to be written: <Insert Language alias here>ClassBuilder and
<Insert Language alias here>Language. Examples would be:
    - CppClassBuilder, CppLanguage
    - RubyClassBuilder, RubyLanguage
    - JavaClassBuilder, JavaLanguage

Just to make my last mail complete.

Hi all.

Just wanted to let you know the new FOX DEV version (1.5.1) includes 
scoll capability. That's great
for opening thousends of files in the TabEditor.

Hi Jochen.

Did you continue working on the project management during the last two 
weeks or did you take
a break? I'm just interested whether there is any progress or not.

Jannis
